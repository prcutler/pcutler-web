The Stone Open is an informal gathering of friends and retail industry employees, including retailers, distributors, 
manufacturer’s representatives and consumer electronics manufacturers meeting for a day of golf, laughs and beverages.

The Stone Open supports The [Special Operations Warrior Foundation](http://specialops.org/) charity and has rasied 
thousands of dollars in support since the Stone Open began over ten years ago.

I maintain the website, player registration and e-commerce for the Stone Open.
