Do you follow [news.gnome.org][1], or subscribe to it in your feedreader? [news.gnome.org][1] is similar to [Planet GNOME][2], but is for project&#8217;s news feeds, where Planet GNOME is for personal feeds.

Stormy posts to the [Foundation blog][3] that updates to news.gnome.org, and she just recently started cross-posting her weekly updates to Planet GNOME as well.

Late yesterday, [Stormy posted an update][4] on the [Friends of GNOME][5] program. We are very close to our $20,000 goal! Thank you to everyone who has donated in 2009!

If you look at our three month trend:

  * April: 110 donors, $3,316 donations for an average of $30
  * May: 258 donors, $7,341 donations for an average of $28
  * June: 116 donors, $1,585 donations for an average of $14

In May and June, 100 of those donors were Friends of GNOME donors donating $10 month. This highlights why monthly donors are so important &#8211; one time donors come and go, and with the call for help that was put out, you can see the effect. But when that ends, it&#8217;s the monthly donors that help with consistent donations that give GNOME the ability to forecast incoming revenue that can be used to help the organization.

[Stormy&#8217;s post][4] contains more information on donations as well as some graphs showing monthly and yearly trends.

Can you help GNOME with $10 a month? For the cost of going out to lunch once a month, you can help one of your favorite free software projects (and get a cool t-shirt and stickers!) Join [Friends of GNOME][5] today!
