A few links to wrap up your week:

  * Minneapolis legend Bob Mould stopped by 89.3 The Current at the UBS Forum this week and read from his new autobiography, _See a Little Light_, and performed a few songs which you can [listen to at The Current][1]. [NPR reviews his new book][2] as well.
  * The Foo Fighters latest album, _Wasting Light_, is [on sale today for only $3.99][3]. Fantastic album, recorded on analog tape, and produced by Butch Vig who produced Nirvana&#8217;s _Nevermind_ and he&#8217;s alo the founder of Garbage. (Bob Mould guests on Dear Rosemary).
  * Rock The Garden is tomorrow featuring Booker T., Tapes and Tapes, Neko Case and My Morning Jacket. The Current will be [airing and streaming the concert live][4] for the first time and has posted set times. The Star Tribune [looks back at past Rock The Garden concerts][5].
  * The [Needle Doctor][6], the best store in the world featuring turntables, needles and all the other hardware you need, is offering 10% off this weekend using the promo code FATHERSDAY.
  * I&#8217;m heading out to the [Rock and Roll Record Sale][7] tonight &#8211; they&#8217;ve been t[weeting up a storm][8] with what&#8217;s available and I&#8217;m hoping to score some [New Order][9], [Siousixe and the Banshees and Talking Heads][10]. I have no idea what prices are though, it will be interesting to see what&#8217;s available in the garage.
