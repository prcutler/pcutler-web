Tonight, I learned all about LVM (Logical Volume Manager) on Linux. How to take 2 hard drives, and tell Linux to look at them as one drive / directory.

Nailed it on the second attempt. Might try it on the server later in the week.

For Wed: Learning rsync. Then I can do incremental backups from the server to my dedicated backup box via cron and never worry about my data again.
