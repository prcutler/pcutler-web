I watched the travesty that is Blade III last night. Oh, how the mighty has fallen.

Blade I & II we&#8217;re good comic book adaptions of an interesting character. Not great movies per se, but good action, decent one lines, and interesting plots. All three were written by David Goyer, but with Guillermo del Toro, who directed the second one, moving on to Hellboy (and it&#8217;s sequel) they gave the director&#8217;s chair to Mr. Goyer. We&#8217;ll blame him for this horrible piece of work.

What did Blade III want to be? A horror film? Because the last half tried to do that. A hard-boiled mystery of what the vampires were up to? An action flick?

The only saving grace was Ryan Reynolds &#8211; his humor and lines were the one spark that kept the movie interesting. The only other things I appreciated were the nods to Blade II through the anatomy of &#8220;Dracula&#8221; and the vampire dogs, and some nods to past movies.

Other than that, the cinematography was horrible &#8211; the scene where Blade is on the roof chasing the baddie, and the camera pans (and later, they did a similar pan around Blade) was bad, the pacing of the movie, especially after the attack on the compound, and the dialogue was terrible. Early in the movie when Blade & Whistler are talking before the FBI storms in, it&#8217;s as if Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson aren&#8217;t even trying &#8211; their acting is wooden and all the chemistry is gone.

And what happened to Parker Posey that she would sign up to do this? The indie flick queen of the 90&#8217;s is in this? What a waste of her talent.

If you appreciated Blade I & II for what they were &#8211; mindless action movies with an interesting take on vampires, stay away from Blade III. Worse than the Matrix Trilogy, it will leave you with such a bad taste in your mouth you won&#8217;t want to watch the first two ever again either.
