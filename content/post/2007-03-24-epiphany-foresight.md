[Epiphany][1] is the default web browser for GNOME, and now as of Foresight 1.1, [Foresight Linux][2].

What is Epiphany? Epiphany is the browser for the GNOME desktop, with it&#8217;s goal to be simple and easy to use. Powered by the [Gecko][3] engine, like Firefox, Epiphany offers [extensions][4], customizable user interface, and [smart bookmarks][5].

[Luis Villa recently published][6] a link of things, in his opinion, Epiphany did superior to Firefox. (No, I&#8217;m not trying to start a flamewar, just food for thought on why you might want to try Epiphany!)

Over at Thilo&#8217;s blog, he [covers why we&#8217;ve made the switch at Foresight Linux][7] and some benefits of using Epiphany. He also is [asking the community][8] what they would like to see in Epiphany on Foresight, from plugins and extensions, and what&#8217;s included in the default Epiphany install on Foresight.

Try Epiphany today &#8211; I was pleasantly surprised by it.
