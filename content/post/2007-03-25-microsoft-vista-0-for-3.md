Microsoft is now 0 for 3 in trying to get me to try Vista. My recent Intel motherboard / Core 2 Duo processor purchase included a copy of Vista when Vista shipped. Surprisingly, Microsoft supplied Intel with both a 32 bit and 64 bit version to send out, each with unique keys.

It&#8217;s sat on my desk since it arrived in the mail a month ago, unopened. I have a friend who I think wants a copy. I looked at ebaying it, but I was surprised how low OEM copies really sell for, so so it sits here.

Today I bought a new laptop, a [Toshiba Satellite A135-S4467][1], with Vista Home Premium on it. I didn&#8217;t even boot it up. Plugged in the battery, a Foresight disc, reformatted the hard drive, installed Foresight and blew away the Vista partition without so much as even looking at what Microsoft is offering these days.

I then used Google a bit to search for tips and tricks to get my Microsoft refund from the OEM. I found some good sites, [one in particular on Linux.com][2], that details what to say to a customer service rep and when to hold firm. The site makes it clear to be able to quote from the EULA, so after a bit of searching, I found Toshiba&#8217;s Master End User License Agreement.

They got me. I think Toshiba has figured out how to avoid that scenario, as the first paragraph, in glorious all capital letters, makes it clear you&#8217;re better off returning the whole thing than trying to get a refund:

> &#8230;TAIS DOES NOT ACCEPT THE THE RETURN OF PRO-RATA REFUNDS ON INDIVIDUAL PC COMPONENTS OR BUNDLE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING THE OPERATING SYSTEM&#8230; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, DO NOT INSTALL, COPY OR USE THE SOFTWARE. IF YOU WISH TO RETURN A COMPLETE HARDWARE PRODUCT STEYM, CONTACT&#8230;

Darn. Later on, in Limitation of Liability, again in all capital letters (what l33t hacker writes EULAs?!):

> TAIS ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THIS EULA SHALL NOT EXCEED U.S. $10.00&#8230;.

Now, I&#8217;m not a lawyer, but I think even if I sweet talked them into giving me money for this wonderful thing called Vista, I&#8217;m entitled to $10.00. Oh boy! A new CD! Wait, the RIAA makes us pay more than $10.00 for those too. Oh boy! A free lunch!

Leave a comment if you know a good work around or have some advice for me to try. If Spam Karma 2 kicks in and moderates the comment, please use the feedback form to let me know.

My thoughts and notes on installing Foresight on the laptop will be coming soon, too.
