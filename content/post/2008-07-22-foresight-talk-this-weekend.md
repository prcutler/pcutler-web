Just a reminder, I&#8217;ll be giving a talk on Foresight this Saturday in St. Paul at [Penguins Unbound][1].

It will be more of an introduction to Foresight to existing Linux users (though I hope a few folks who don&#8217;t use Linux are there), and I&#8217;ll have some install discs to give out.

The meeting starts at 10:00 a.m., hit the link above for directions. See you there!
