I just installed Red Hat 9 on my old gaming rig, and I just can&#8217;t believe how great it is.

I thought Red Hat 8 was good, worthy of up a full number upgrade over 7.3, Bluecurve was a step in the right direction, but 9 is really that good. The fonts are the best I&#8217;ve seen &#8211; and that&#8217;s something I had always wanted to update previously on my RH and Debian boxes, but 9 is fantastic. The software is good and up to date without being scary new, apt-get works like a charm (thanks [Freshrpms][1]!), the menu issues were fixed, and the network browser works great.

Just having installed it again, it&#8217;s slick, installs easily, and just runs. I replaced my Debian box with it &#8212; running a version called &#8220;unstable&#8221; just never seemed right, though I love Debian, both from a technology standpoint and a belief standpoint. I think Red Hat is doing the right thing in taking a stance on copyright issues similar to Debian with MP3, NTFS, etc. And Red Hat is doing it without falling behind on the applications front.

I can&#8217;t recommend Red Hat enough &#8211; it was more than worth it to buy a Red Hat Network subscription.
