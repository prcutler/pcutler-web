GNOME 3 is out! I started to writing a thank you listing out individuals but it became way too long and I was afraid I&#8217;d forget somebody. So let me just say thank you to every developer, translator, documentation writers, marketers and everyone else who&#8217;s contributed to GNOME.

[Download and try it][2], [check out the videos][3], the [new website][4] and [Planet][5], the new [GNOME Journal all about GNOME 3][6], and let us know what you think.

(And a special thanks to the sysadmins who are trying to keep the site up thanks to all the traffic we&#8217;re getting!)
