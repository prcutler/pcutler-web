[Via BoingBoing][1]:

CartoonBrew.com [is reporting][2] that Turner Classic Movies is planning to air 9 Miyazaki films (the one&#8217;s Disney acquired distribution rights for) in January. The titles include _Spirited Away, Kiki&#8217;s Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind, Castle in the Sky, Porco Rosso and Whisper of the Heart._

If you haven&#8217;t seen a Miyazaki film &#8211; even the popular ones such as Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away, you owe it to yourself to check out these animated classics. It&#8217;s unknown at this time whether they will be dubbed or sub-titled, but either way this is some of the best animated movies you&#8217;ll ever see.
