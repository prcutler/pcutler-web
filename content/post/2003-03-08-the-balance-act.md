I wrote my congressman, [John Kline][1] tonight in support of <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c108:1<img src='https://i0.wp.com/www.silwenae.net/blogs/img/smilies/grayshy.gif?w=700' alt='&#58;&#46;' class='middle' data-recalc-dims="1" />/temp/~c108QQUcWi::&#8221;>House Resolution 1066</a>, The Balance Act, introduced by [Rep Zoe Lofgren (D &#8211; CA)][2]. This resolution would repeal key aspects of the travesty that is the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA). The DMCA has been invoked for such silly things as suing ink-jet refillers. Tell me how they&#8217;re invalidating a copyright again? Especially when they&#8217;ve reversed engineer it on their own!

For more information on the DMCA, visit [Anti-DMCA.org.][3]

Write your congressman today!
