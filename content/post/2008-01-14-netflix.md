After a two year break, I signed up for Netflix again. Towards the end of my last subscription, I was paying $15 / month to hang on to two or three DVDs I never got around to watching. I&#8217;m the type of customer Netflix loves &#8211; really active, then a couple months of inactivity.

To curb my habit of buying Blu-Ray movies (they&#8217;re so pretty in HD!), I signed up again yesterday. And today comes news [they are offering unlimited watching of movies online][1]. Of course, it&#8217;s Windows only, so sucks to be me. Still not a good enough reason to use Windows though!
