[Reading the news][1] that Bret Ratner is taking over filming X3 (X-men 3), I did a double take when I saw:

> The original returning stars have been signed, and the cast is bolstered by Kelsey Grammer, Vinnie Jones and Maggie Grace (&#8220;Lost&#8221;), who just came aboard as new mutant characters. (As reported by VARIETY)

Kelsey Grammer? _Really?_ I have to assume he&#8217;s the villain &#8211; his over the top acting _might_ work in that role.

Wait and see, I guess.
