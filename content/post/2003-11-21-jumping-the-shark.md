I think [Inside the Actor&#8217;s Studio][1] has jumped the shark.

I have my TiVo set to record all of the new episodes, and the latest one with the cast of Will & Grace, was disappointing.

About 6 months ago, NBC bought out Bravo (as you can see from the re-airings of West Wing, Boomtown, and the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy partnership). 

If NBC hadn&#8217;t bought Bravo, would we have seen the cast of Will & Grace on Inside the Actor&#8217;s Studio? Probably not. As one of the anchor&#8217;s for NBC&#8217;s Must See TV Thursday night, and soon to be &#8220;the&#8221; anchor with the demise of Friends after this season, I believe NBC used the Actor&#8217;s Studio to help position Will & Grace.

At the beginning of the show during the interviews, James Lipton even introduces the President of Bravo (and VP of NBC) who is sitting in the audience.

The show itself wasn&#8217;t bad &#8211; I might not care for Will & Grace, but with the 4 lead actors they also had the two main writers, and James Burroughs (director). It was interesting to hear them talk and James Burroughs is an icon himself, with his work on Taxi, and directing 75% of all Cheers episodes.

I can appreciate NBC flexing their marketing muscle. And I understand why they purchased Bravo. But I think it&#8217;s unfortunate that the one show that should have remained pure and free from marketing bias was affected.

(And I&#8217;m still waiting for the anniversary episode that Will Ferrell referred to on Dinner for Five on IFC &#8211; where Will Ferrell (as James Lipton) interviews James Lipton!)
