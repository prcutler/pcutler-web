Mac Daily News [is reporting that OS X for x86 is available on P2P networks][1] after someone took the developer version and seeded it.

Supposedly, it will work on any Intel processor, and the iLife applications are already compiled for x86. Mac Daily News goes on to theorize that Apple knew exactly what it was doing when it offered the developer edition after watching Tiger burn up the p2p circuit. The theory is Apple is offering a try before you buy scenario for OS X _right now_.

I wish I could say I thought Apple was that smart&#8230; they had to know this would happen, but that they planned it? A bit of a stretch.
