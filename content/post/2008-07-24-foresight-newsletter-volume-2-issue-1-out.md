After months of slacking on my part, I am proud to announce a [new issue of the Foresight Newsletter][1] is out.

Now in to it&#8217;s second year, this issue gives an overview on the latest releases, including both 2.0.4 and 2.0, community news, a look back at the first Foresight User & Developer Conference, upcoming conferences, and other information. (Considering everything that&#8217;s happened, it could have been stuffed with news, but I really needed to push out a release and give myself a kick start).

Next month expected a more detailed in development section, and if my evil plan comes to life, this may even be the last month it&#8217;s released via the Foresight Wiki. (Cross your fingers!)

Enjoy the newsletter, and I&#8217;m always on the lookout for anyone who wants to lend a hand in writing for it as well.
