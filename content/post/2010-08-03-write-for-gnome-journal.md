With GUADEC having just ended, we&#8217;re looking for some GUADEC related stories for GNOME Journal.

Here&#8217;s a few examples:

  * Was it your first time at GUADEC? Share some thoughts about what you liked, saw or who you met.
  * Did you give a talk at GUADEC? Write it up as an article! Or, we&#8217;re happy to do an interview with you about your talk. Here&#8217;s a [great example with J5][1] after last year&#8217;s GUADEC.
  * Did you see a new application or new technology that gets you excited? We&#8217;re always looking for app reviews. Write it up and we&#8217;ll include it!

If any of these interest you, please drop me an email at pcutler at gnome dot org. Don&#8217;t be shy &#8211; if you want a member of the GJ team to interview you, just ask!
