One of my favorite Christmas presents to receive is a Barnes & Noble gift card. And this year my sister hooked the family up with a dandy. Alex was able to purchase two nice hardcovers by Garth Nix, and I picked up a few.

On my list for quite a while is a few books by [Lawrence Lessig][1], founder of [Creative Commons][2], [EFF][3] board member, and a Stanford law professor. I bought [The Future of Ideas][4] and [Free Culture][5]: How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Control Creativity.

In addition, I picked up [We The Media][6], Grassroots Journalism By the People, For the People by [Dan Gillmor][7], who recently put his money where his mouth is, and left his job at the San Jose Mercury News to found a grassroots journalism project.

And last, but not least, Geoffrey Stone&#8217;s [Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism][8]. Mr. Stone [had the opportunity to guest on][9], but who else&#8217;s, Lawrence Lessig&#8217;s blog in December. Fascinating thoughts, facts, and history behind the governments role in free speech regulation during wartime. I&#8217;m really looking forward to reading this book.

It feels good to be buying non-fiction, and topics I believe in: Free Speech, copyright reform, and journalism. Now to finish off the two novels I&#8217;m reading and tackle some real reading material.
