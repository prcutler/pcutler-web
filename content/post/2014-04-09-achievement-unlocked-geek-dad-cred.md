I took the kids to [Captain America: The Winter Soldier][1] this past Sunday. You know it&#8217;s going to be a blockbuster when the theater is 75% filled at a 9:30 a.m. showing on a Sunday morning. I usually like to take the kids to the early showing as the theater is almost empty on Sunday mornings.

_**Warning: Minor Spoiler**_

Two thirds of the way through the movie, Natasha Romanova (Black Widow), played by Scarlett Johansson, and Steve Rogers (Captain America), played by Chris Evans, enter an abandoned military base with an ancient mainframe computer system. Natasha Romanova turns to Captain America, and asks in a monotone, &#8220;_Would you like to play a game?_&#8221; Right out of the 1983 movie _[WarGames][2]_. Zoe turns to me in the theater, her face all lit up, as she gets the in-joke, mostly in there for my generation.

We had just watched _Wargames_ a couple months ago on Netflix, right before it was set to expire. (Alas, it&#8217;s still expired and not available for streaming.)

That was definitely a warm fuzzy knowing I&#8217;ve contributed to my kids geek credibility. Achievement Unlocked.
