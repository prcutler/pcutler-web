Just in time for your weekend reading pleasure, GNOME Journal #18 is out. Issue 18 is a special edition focusing on Multimedia & GNOME, as well as recap of the recent Boston Summit.

  * Writing Multimedia Applications in Vala by Jim Nelson
  * Pitivi by Jono Bacon
  * What&#8217;s new with Banshee by Joe &#8216;Zonker&#8217; Brockmeier
  * An interview with Jonathan Thomas, creator of the OpenShot video editor by Paul Cutler
  * Boston Summit Recap by Jason Clinton

This issue features four (4!) new authors and the GNOME Journal team is thankful for their contribution. We also couldn&#8217;t have done it without our editors: Stormy Peters, Sumana Harihareswara, and Jim Hodapp.
