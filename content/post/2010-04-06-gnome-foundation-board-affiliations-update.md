With the recent additions to the Board in the last couple of months and some job changes (including myself last week) since the elections last year, we wanted to provide a quick update on current Board affiliations:

  * Brian Cameron (Oracle)
  * Jorge Castro (Canonical)
  * Paul Cutler (Novell)
  * Diego Escalante Urrelo (Igalia &#8211; [Internship][1])
  * Germán Póo-Caamaño (No affiliation)
  * Srinivasa Ragavan ([Intel][2])
  * Vincent Untz (Novell)

The Foundation Board <a href=http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2009-May/msg00017.html">election process started in May</a> last year &#8211; if you haven&#8217;t renewed your Foundation membership or wish to become a Foundation member [now is a great time to apply][3] (and save the Membership committee some work!)
