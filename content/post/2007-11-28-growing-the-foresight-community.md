[Og&#8217;s latest blog][1] post links to [David Bolter&#8217;s blog with a post on &#8220;Transparency in Community Decisions&#8221;][2]. David writes:

> Transparency should be applied to how decisions can get made in FOSS communities. This can involve different layers; for example, transparency could apply to:
> 
> 1. Who gets to participate in decision making.
  
> 2. How these people are selected.
  
> 3. The process of decision making.
> 
> In FOSS communities I think transparency should apply to all three where reasonably possible. What do I mean by this? Let&#8217;s take a couple of examples:
> 
> A) Getting hired by a FOSS organization which is integral to the community.
  
> B) Getting commit access to an svn repository.
  
> C) Getting syndication of one&#8217;s blog onto a planet/aggregator.

The timing of this couldn&#8217;t be better. The [Foresight Marketing Team][3] is about to tackle some of these exact tasks, specifically on what it means to become a user and developer within Foresight. This includes perks, such as IRC hostmasks or foresightlinux.org email addresses, but more importantly how to get commit access.

We don&#8217;t have all of the answers yet, especially for 1-3 above (other than [Ken][4] gets veto power!). But David&#8217;s post highlights the need for transparency, not only in how we build these processes, but how we execute them going forward.

We will be having a Marketing meeting sometime in the next week or so, with details to come soon.
