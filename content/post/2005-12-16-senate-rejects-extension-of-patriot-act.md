[Senate Rejects Extension of Patriot Act][1]

Sen. Feingold has Senators listening! With a vote of 52-47, 8 short to override a filibuster, Senators today rejected extending the Patriot Act. Senators from all sides joined Sen. Feingold in opposing this terrible piece of legislation that stomps on American&#8217;s civil liberties.

> &#8220;We can come together to give the government the tools it needs to fight terrorism and protect the rights and freedoms of innocent citizens,&#8221; said Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., arguing that provisions permitting government access to confidential personal data lacked safeguards to protect the innocent.
> 
> &#8220;We need to be more vigilant,&#8221; agreed Sen. John Sununu (news, bio, voting record), a Republican from New Hampshire, where the state motto is &#8220;Live Free or Die.&#8221; He quoted Benjamin Franklin: &#8220;Those that would give up essential liberty in pursuit of a little temporary security deserve neither liberty nor security.&#8221;
