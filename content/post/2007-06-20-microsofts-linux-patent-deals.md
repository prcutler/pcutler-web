As a [long time][1] Red Hat stockholder, let me say thank you to Red Hat&#8217;s leadership for [flatly rejecting Microsoft&#8217;s overtures][2] for interoperability and protection from patent suits. From the Yahoo! News article:

> Microsoft made its intentions clear on Friday: It wants to work out a cross-licensing deal with the largest Linux vendor on the market that would look much the same as its recent agreements with Xandros and Linspire.
> 
> Red Hat quickly dashed all hopes, standing on its previous statements from last November, issued in the wake of the controversial Novell deal. Red Hat left no room for misinterpretation when it said the company would not compromise on its open-source roots.
> 
> &#8220;An innovation tax is unthinkable,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &#8220;Free and open-source software provide the necessary environment for true innovation. Innovation without fear or threat. Activities that isolate communities or limit upstream adoption will inevitably stifle innovation.&#8221; 

To Red Hat, Ubuntu and all the others in the future who reject this deal: Thank you.
