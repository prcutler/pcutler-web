I vividly remember the day [Rev105][4] changed formats. My wife and I were leaving work and climbed into the car in the carpool lot. Turning on the car, Van Halen was playing. I was surprised, but I&#8217;ve always been a Van Halen fan, and dug that they were playing it. Rev105 was the most eclectic radio station I&#8217;ve ever listened to, and while I was surprised to hear Van Halen, it wasn&#8217;t out of the norm from some of the things they played. And then another hard rock song came on, and another &#8211; and they announced the new call letters, X105. And just like that, my favorite radio station was dead.

The latest Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees were announced a week and a half ago. To celebrate, 89.3 The Current played a number of the inductees, including:

  * Hall and Oates
  * Linda Rondstadt
  * Cat Stevens
  * Peter Gabriel

Mary Lucia was driving to work when they played the above artists and missed Barb Abney&#8217;s introduction to the set list. [Her reaction was hilarious][5], along with the voicemail she left to Jill Riley, co-host of the morning show on The Current:

> I FREAKED out! Not another format change! This isn’t happening again! I was convinced we had flipped formats overnight and this was my way of finding out I no longer had a job at the Current.
> 
> I know this sounds overly dramatic, but friends, this has happened to me before in my radio career: One day I have a job, and the next day we are playing Scorpions and Nazareth. BOOM! “Thanks for all of your hard work, now who needs a box to pack up your [stuff]?” 

[Hit the link to read her reaction][5], listen to the voicemail and the Twitter reactions by people around the Twin Cities.

Kudos to The Current for sharing this &#8211; it brought a smile to my face.
