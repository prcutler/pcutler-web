I updated my Linksys [WRT-54GS][1] (1.0) to [dd-wrt][2] last night, replacing Linksys&#8217; firmware with the latest dd-wrt release, DD-WRT v24 (05/20/08) mega.

What a great experience. The [documentation is complete][3], and has howto&#8217;s for all the different models that are compatible, and it was a snap following the step by step instructions.

I did a factory reset, uploaded the new firmware via Linksys&#8217;s web gui, another factory reset to load the firmware, and voila, open source firmware running on my Linksys router.

The admin pages for managing the router are well designed, in both layout and functionality. And the funtionality &#8211; wow! So much you can do, from QOS, SSH, to boosting the range, or enabling all kinds of WPA protection that weren&#8217;t available via Linkys&#8217;s firmware.

I&#8217;ve just started playing with it, but so far I&#8217;m very impressed. I welcome my new open-source dd-wrt masters.
