My father and I were able to purchase season tickets again this year from a family member.

I spent this past Sunday driving to and from Lambeau Field (about 4.5 &#8211; 5 hours each way) and it was definitely worth it.

Prior to the game, there was a convention in Green Bay this past week hosting most living Congressional Medal of Honor recipients. Before the game, Brian Williams of NBC introduced, by war, those living Medal of Honor recipients who were able to attend the convention and game. The four living Wisconsin recipients were also honorary captains for the day. Prior to kickoff, four F-16s did a flyby.

Most of the drive to Green Bay once I hit Wisconsin was cloudy and rainy. Sure enough, the drizzle started at kickoff for 30 minutes, but by halftime the clouds parted and the sun was shining brightly.

The game was a nailbiter &#8211; after a 10-0 Packer start in the first quarter, I had visions of the Saints game from last year which I was at, where the Packers jumped to a large lead only to give it away. The defense was phenomenal, as was the special teams play. The offense, well, let&#8217;s just say they have their work cut out from them.

I brought my new Digital SLR (Canon Rebel XTi) to the game, but I ran out of battery by kick off as I was practicing taking photos with it during pre-game. It was the first time I&#8217;ve used the telescopic lens, which I was very impressed with when in Sports mode on the camera firing off 3 shots / second. I still have some learning to do on proper focusing when using that lens though. You can [view the set on Flickr here][1], and here is one of my favorite pictures I took watching Favre warm up:

Next game: Sunday, October 9th against the Chicago Bears. This will be the first time I&#8217;ve seen the Bears at Lambeau, and is the only real rivalry the Packers have.
