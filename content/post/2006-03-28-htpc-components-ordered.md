I ordered all of the parts for my home theater PC over the weekend, as a few things were on sale. Of course, my basement needs to cooperate and stop flooding. I have to get the carpet / pad replaced now. But this gives me two months to get the system built, Ubuntu installed, and [MythTV][1] configured.

  * [1 pcHDTV HD3000][2] PCI card for watching / recording HDTV with.
  * Abit 939 Motherboard (KN8), to go with the x2 4800+ I&#8217;ve had for a while. 
  * 2 GB of Corsair RAM
  * 1 Silverstone LC16 home theater PC case, with 500w silent power supply, and 2 extra 80mm fans
  * 1 Pioneer DVD-RW drive (black)
  * 3 Seagate 300GB SATAII hard drives (call it 100 hours of HDTV recording)
  * And a Hauppauge PVR-250 for recording standard def TV that I&#8217;ve been hanging on to for a while
  * 1 BFG 6600GT PCIe video card &#8211; needed a GT to fit in the HTPC case

Almost everything was ordered from Newegg and PC Alchemy.

I need to do some more research if I should be using Ubuntu&#8217;s 64 bit version with MythTV, I&#8217;ve read mixed things. But the AMD x2 should perform extremely well for a HTPC. It won&#8217;t be easy getting everything configured, but god knows I&#8217;ve been researching it long enough, and now it&#8217;s go time.
