This Saturday, March 30th, is [Table Top Day][1]! [Geek & Sundry][2] has organized an international day to support, enjoy and play table top games. About a year ago a friend invited a friend of ours, my eldest son and myself over to have a table top gaming night. I was blown away by number of games now available. You&#8217;ve probably heard of some of the biggest, such as Settlers of Catan, but there is a revolution going on in old school games. We don&#8217;t get together as often as we&#8217;d like, but about a month ago we scheduled it for this Friday night &#8211; coincidentally, just a day before Table Top Day, which Felicia Day talks about in the video above.

I&#8217;ve bought a number of games to play with my littler two over the last year, most notably [Castle Panic][3] and [Small World][4]. Tuesday nights are now game night with the kids, whether it&#8217;s a board game, chess or a card game. We usually try and play more games over the weekend as well. I really like that Castle Panic is a co-op game &#8211; working together takes a lot of the competitiveness (and trash talking) out, making a more enjoyable experience for everyone.

Small World also [released an iPad version][5] last year and are now working on Small World 2. The sequel is looking for [funding on Kickstarter][6], with the hope of building a version for PC (on Steam), Android tablets, and iPad. If you&#8217;ve already purchased the iPad game, it will be a free upgrade on iPad.

One of my favorite features of Small World 2, is if the player starting the game owns any of the expansions, you get to play the expansion as well &#8211; even if you haven&#8217;t bought it. 

I highly recommend Small World &#8211; if you&#8217;re looking for a new take on the classic board game, this game has it all &#8211; strategy, quick combat and turns, and infinitely replayable.
