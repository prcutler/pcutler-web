I had the pleasure last night of seeing the Tyson / Etienne fight. It&#8217;s actually the first live boxing fight I&#8217;ve ever seen. (I&#8217;ve seen others, but they&#8217;re always tape delay). So Tyson whiffs about 5 times, hits a couple, then a big hit to the face and Etienne goes down.

He goes down, and immediately takes his mouthpiece out. What is that about? Then Tyson helps him up after he&#8217;s been counted out. Tyson has **_never_** done that before.

Of course boxing isn&#8217;t rigged. Really.
