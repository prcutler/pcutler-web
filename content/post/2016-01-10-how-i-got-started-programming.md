As I attempt to learn Python, I&#8217;m fascinated by how people are able to do this as well as how they started to learn to program.

I&#8217;m not the only one, as Ryan Gordon (aka [Icculus][1]), a well known game developer who ports many games to Linux and Mac, asked a similar question on Twitter last month.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
  <p dir="ltr" lang="en">
    Everyone tell me &#8220;how I got started programming&#8221; stories, please! I love them. <a href="https://t.co/Rrk3GDtXjX">https://t.co/Rrk3GDtXjX</a>

This led to a lot of interesting tweets and Ryan [created a Storify page to share them][2]. Josh &#8220;Cheeseness&#8221; Bush [wrote up a great analysis][3] of those tweets sharing graphs looking at the languages, hardware and more about the people who replied used to get started with programming.

Even though I&#8217;m just starting to formally learn to code now, my story with computers is similar to a lot of those stories.

It all started in the early 80s when my father bought a [Timex Sinclair TS1000][4] (aka ZX81) and then a TS1500.  You could load games via tape and also buy magazines with the code to program your own games.  I spent hours handtyping machine code to create games like Breakout.

A few years later my father bought an Apple //c and I then learned Logo, Basic and others.  Nothing that I ever really stuck with from a programming stand point, but enough to learn the basics and spend hours tinkering.

After that, my father bought a an IBM clone 286.  I remember being at Sears with him and telling him to spend the extra money to get a 386, but even a 286 was at least $2,000 back then.  I remember it ran GeOS for a graphical interface and one Christmas, after I received the original Wing Comannder as a gift, I had to buy MS-DOS 5 just so I could use the himem.sys to have enough memory to run the game.

From the Apple //c on, we always had a modem as well.  Starting with a 300 baud modem to a 1200 baud modem later, I started visiting BBSes on the Apple //c and later on the IBM clone as well.  (We had a Compuserve account early on, but hourly charges!  Ouch.) As a teenager I would go to meetups and actually meet the people I was interacting with on a BBS in a real life &#8211; something I&#8217;d do twenty years later when I got involved in open source and [GNOME][5].

Using Linux for years and being involved with GNOME, taught me how to use a shell, basic XML with Docbook, and revision control with Git.  But now it&#8217;s time to learn a formal language and make my first program.

In many ways, I still consider myself an early adopter and if it weren&#8217;t having access to computers at a young age, both in home and in school, I&#8217;d be a much different person today.
