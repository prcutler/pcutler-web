Last Thursday, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune [ran an article saying Sen. Mark Dayton, with Sen. Coleman, would support the Amendment to ban flag-burning][1].

I am absolutely outraged that Sen. Dayton, would change his mind on this topic.

So Sen. Mark Dayton has hopped on the flag-burning-amendment bandwagon (Star Tribune, May 30).

[Ben Seymour, in a letter to the editor in the Star Tribune, put it best:][2]

> Dayton is echoing the rhetoric used to stifle criticism of our government. &#8220;There&#8217;s something in this country that ought to be above government and all the debates in the parties,&#8221; he says.
> 
> In a democracy, no idea with broad support is above debate. We should question the motives of these politicians.
> 
> It&#8217;s pathetic when they return from their dead soldier pilgrimages with &#8220;patriotic&#8221; epiphanies, which in reality are ill-reasoned, American-ideal-desecrating attempts at popularity boosting, at best. 

As you can see [here on the ACLU&#8217;s page against this amendment][3], even Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chief&#8217;s of Staff, agrees with me on this one:

> &#8220;The First Amendment exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but also that which we find outrageous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.&#8221; 

Cuba jails dissidents over flag desecration. Is this what we have sunk to in the name of &#8220;patriotism&#8221;?

Email, fax, or write your members in Congress **[here][3]**.
