My son Alex [has a blog][1].

And like his father, his alias (Nadrin) was randomly generated by a game.

My wife registered the domain and added it to my hosting account, and I installed WordPress for him this weekend, and he picked out the theme.

Good to know geekery runs in the family!

Here he is at his desk, his monitor is just out of sight on the left.
