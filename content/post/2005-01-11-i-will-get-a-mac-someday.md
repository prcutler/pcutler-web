And that day is getting closer.

Today marked the start of MacWorld, and in typical Steve Jobs fashion, he unveiled a slew of new things. I won&#8217;t get into all the cool software, but Jobs did unveil the iPod Shuffle, a flash drive iPod, and more imporantly, the [Mac Mini][1].

A headless Mac G4, you buy this wonderful little piece of technology, and bring your own monitor, mouse and keyboard. It is tiny, cute and semi-powerful (for a Mac). It lacks a decent video card, but who games on Apple machines anyway.

I think this is a smart move for Apple &#8211; with the success of iTunes, they may be able to pull off their Switch campaign yet. Starting at $499 for a G4 1.25 gHz with a 40 gig HD, to $599 for a 1.42 gHz with an 80 gig HD, you can upgrade &#8217;em to DVD burners, wireless as well as bluetooth. Introduce yourself to the power of Unix in a cute form factor.
