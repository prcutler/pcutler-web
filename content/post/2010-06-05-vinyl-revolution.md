When I was 17 or18 years old, I wanted to be a DJ with a friend of mine. I grabbed all of my parents vinyl records, trucked them over to my friend&#8217;s house and then&#8230; we didn&#8217;t do anything. He and I eventually had a falling out and a couple years later when I inquired about getting the records back, I was dismayed to learn that his basement had flooded and they were trashed.

I don&#8217;t think my father has forgiven me to this day.

I grew up heavily influenced by music, including my parents listening to their records and favorite artists such as ABBA, Billy Joel and Elton John. I remember periods of my life based on the music I was listening to at the time and if I hear a specific song it can take me back right to that moment.

I&#8217;ve been thinking about buying a turntable for the last few years and re-creating some of those memories. I participated in [Record Store Day][1] last year shopping at a [local store][2] and picking up a number of CDs and this year on Record Store Day I went out and this time picked up some [used and new vinyl records][3] and then bought a turntable off Craigslist. (An early 80s Pioneer direct-drive).

I&#8217;m one of growing number of people getting back into vinyl &#8211; just visit [The Future of Vinyl blog][5] for non-stop [media][6] [coverage][7] of the growth of vinyl over the last couple years &#8211; it&#8217;s now the fastest growing segment of the (dying) music industry. Even [large retailers like Best Buy][8] are getting in on it. (Though I found their selection disappointing &#8211; very few new records, just 180g re-issues of older material, and for the same prices as the local stores, who I would rather support).

I own more CDs than I can count, and even if it&#8217;s in my head, I do think vinyl sounds better. There is something to be said for the crackle and hiss of a well worn and loved album playing on a stereo. 

I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s more fun &#8211; listening to the albums or shopping for them. I&#8217;ve already bought over 60 records in the last 6 weeks, the bulk of them at two events. The first was a private collector who put an ad in Craigslist and was selling over 5000 records with most of them going for 3 for a dollar. The second sale was today at the [Minnesota Record Show][9] which is held four times a year and features a number of dealers selling records for a few bucks each to rare albums worth hundreds of dollars. On average at an event like this or in the local record stores, used albums are about $3 each. I have bought a few re-issues on 180 gram vinyl of some of my favorite albums of all time, such as Depeche Mode&#8217;s Music for the Masses. (Most albums are 120 grams &#8211; the thicker the album the higher the fidelity).

But what impresses me the most is the resurgence in current artists releasing vinyl day and date with CD &#8211; and including MP3 or FLAC downloads for free when you purchase the vinyl record. I&#8217;ve picked up some great new albums, including the latest from [The Hold Steady][11], [The New Pornographers][12] and [Broken Bells][13].

My wife laughs at me every time I say &#8220;I&#8217;m going downstairs to listen to some records&#8221; but I&#8217;m enjoying the experience immensely. She also says I&#8217;m done collecting for a while, but don&#8217;t tell her, I have my eyes on some more new releases and I heard about another upcoming show&#8230;
