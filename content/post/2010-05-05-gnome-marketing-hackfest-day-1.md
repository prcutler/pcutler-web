Ten brave souls have gathered in windy Zaragoza, Spain for a [GNOME Marketing Hackfest][1] to work on a marketing plan and materials for the upcoming GNOME 3.0 launch.

Day one is already done and we&#8217;re well on our way into day two and we&#8217;re getting a lot of stuff done.

Sumana has done a [great job at summarizing our first day][3] and she&#8217;s jumped in and volunteered to act as our project manager.  She&#8217;s making sure we&#8217;re staying on topic and focused.  (Thanks Sumana!)

We&#8217;re working on a GNOME 3 website where we can host some cool videos showing the features and benefits of GNOME 3 as well as making it easy to represent GNOME at events.  We&#8217;re working on presentations and templates you could use to give a talk about GNOME, materials to host a booth at a conference such as SCALE or Ohio Linux Fest and more.

Even Vincent is surprised how much we are getting done:

We have two more days of work ahead of us and Friday we will be meeting and giving talks with a number of local government and business community members about free software in the community, business and education. (More [photos here too][5], will be updated throughout the week).
