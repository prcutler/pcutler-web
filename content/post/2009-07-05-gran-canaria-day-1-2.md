My head is still buzzing from all the activity here at Gran Canaria. This is both my first time at GUADEC, and in Europe. That, combined with all the different people I&#8217;ve been meeting and conversations I&#8217;ve been having, has my head spinning in a good way.

I&#8217;ve really gotten a kick out of meeting people, and the reactions I get:

  * I&#8217;m the GNOME Journal guy. Please come see me, I need writers! And Jorge and I have something special planned for Wednesday, so make sure you find one of us.
  * I&#8217;m the GNOME Docs guy. &#8220;You sure blog a lot!&#8221; Well sure, I write stuff.
  * I&#8217;m the GNOME marketing guy. This one might make me the happiest, as I&#8217;ve blogged the least about it. We have some pretty cool stuff lined up for the Marketing team, and I&#8217;ll make sure I blog about it soon.

The talks have been great so far. I enjoyed r0ml&#8217;s keynote yesterday the most. I wish I could verbalize all the thoughts in my head around his talk, but it was a great way to think about code. RMS&#8217; talk, well, not so much, as others [have][1] [blogged][2].

Today&#8217;s sessions were great &#8211; a good one on Community from Alexandra of Nokia, and Owen&#8217;s talk on GNOME Shell was awesome.

Thank you to everyone in the community for making me feel welcome, I&#8217;m having a great time here!
