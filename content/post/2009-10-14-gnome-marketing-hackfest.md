We are in the [final phases of planning][1] a Marketing Hackfest to be held in Chicago, IL USA Tuesday and Wednesday, November 10th and 11th.

Google has been gracious to host us at their offices in Chicago and Novell is also helping with sponsorship.

Is this something you&#8217;d be interested in?  [Join the Marketing mailing list and let us know][2]!

We&#8217;re finalizing the agenda now, but we have lots of stuff to work on, including:

  * Case studies of GNOME success stories
  * The new GNOME.org website
  * Presentation materials
  * GNOME 3.0 marketing campaign
  * GNOME Event box materials including posters, brochures and more

And that&#8217;s just a sampling! If you&#8217;re good with art, writing or editing we&#8217;d love to have you there. Nothing is quite like a hackfest and feeling the energy created by working together in the same room getting stuff done.
