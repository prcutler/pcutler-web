On the way home tonight, I stopped off at Best Buy and picked up the Seagate FreeAgent 250GB external hard drive that&#8217;s on sale this week. Now that I have an office, I wanted to take my music with me to work so I could listen during the day. (Yay for having an office!)

It comes formatted as NTFS, which annoys me to no end. It lists on the box it&#8217;s NTFS, and works with XP / Vista, and MacOS, both PowerPC and Intel. At least I knew what I was buying.

But NTFS is notoriously difficult to work with on Linux, though the NTFS 3G driver has made a lot of progress. And of course my system doesn&#8217;t have the NTFS 3G driver installed.

Whatever happened to good old FAT32?

How annoying. Luckily, I have a Mac Mini and one Windows box left. I was feeling lazy.
