I have never read a Harry Potter book. As avid a reader as I am, once something hits the mainstream, especially so ferociously, I just have to be different and not do it. (I&#8217;ve never seen Titanic either).

With that said, I took Alex this morning to Target post-haste and we purchased Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.

A number of years back when Harry Potter was just starting to become popular, my wife bought a couple of the books and read them to decide if we could read them aloud to Alex or let him read them when he was older. She loved them, and he has loved them for the past couple of years.

Which led to being a good little American consumer this morning. I figure I won&#8217;t see Alex for a day or two until he&#8217;s done reading it.
