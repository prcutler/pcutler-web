Back in July, I [blogged][1] about Icculus [starting a port][2] of [Second Life][3].

About a month ago, I signed up for a Second Life account as it was: a) free and b) you need an account to get on the Second Life forums. I was looking for an answer or update on the Linux port. I didn&#8217;t find anything, but I headed back today, and [found this][4] post by Andrew Linden on the Linden staff:

He wanted to work on it in his copius spare time and LL&#8217;s stance was, &#8220;If you can do it, great!&#8221;. He made some rapid progress, then got sidetracked and never got back to it. I prodded him twice but he didn&#8217;t reply.

Very interesting. Nice to have an update, and I&#8217;m intrigued that Icculus started the port on his own. I&#8217;m curious if he had the source from Linden Labs, or used the Mac client to port it to Linux. I&#8217;m disappointed that it never got finished, but I more than understand getting sidetracked when you were working on it for free.

[Icculus.org][5] is down (just today) switching ISPs, and I think Icculus has a FAQ up about contacting him &#8211; and this is one of those topics that are probably taboo. Bummer.
