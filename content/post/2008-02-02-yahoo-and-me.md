I&#8217;ve read enough of the stories of Microsoft&#8217;s takeover bid for Yahoo!, and I hate to contribute more, but [Wired has a great story][1] on the Flickr communities&#8217; reaction.

I&#8217;m a Yahoo! user by acquisition. I absolutely adore [Flickr][2], with over 4000 photos posted and viewed over 67,000 times. (My Foresight screenshot is #1 for me with 2000 views). I bought a Pro account when Flickr first launched, ages before it was acquired, and was rewarded for overpaying by gaining a year. I have hundreds of bookmarks at [del.icio.us][3] (which annoy Planet readers to no end as they auto-post to my blog). I applaud Yahoo!s recent OpenID implementation.

But I&#8217;ve seen first hand what Microsoft does with its acquisitions. If I was a Yahoo! shareholder, I&#8217;d take the money and run. Their stock has been declining for years. Their search market share is stagnant. Their media strategy, including music, isn&#8217;t really working.

But does it have to be Microsoft? Please, no. Anyone know how to migrate photos from Flickr to Picasa?
