Badgers looked good today in QB&#8217;s John Stocco&#8217;s debut. The ESPN crew touched on his story briefly: After passing Matt Schabert last year on the depth chart to #2 behind Jim Sorgi, John was a bit shy and uncomfortable replacing Matt, who was also his roommate. After being demoted to #3, Matt left Wisconsin for a Division I-AA school this year, where he could be the starting QB.

Anthony Davis looked good, until getting hurt, again. Booker Stanley was so-so at RB. The new defensive coordinator&#8217;s scheme seemed to work, but nothing stood out about it. Not a lot of blitzing, and Scott Starks at CB will never start in the NFL.

I had told my dad this morning I would be happy to see the Badgers run up the score on University of Central Florida, as they are now the home to disgraced coach George O&#8217;Leary. I made the remark because after O&#8217;Leary was forced to resign at Notre Dame he spent 2 years on Mice Tice&#8217;s staff at the Minnesota Vikings, with the second year as defensive coordinator. Turn on the game today, and O&#8217;Leary isn&#8217;t even at the game as he&#8217;s attending his mother&#8217;s funeral. Oops.

Badgers should have a good year. If Stocco emerges in the mold of how Trent Dilfer played for Baltimore a few years back, as a steady, mistake free QB who doesn&#8217;t have to put up big yards, the Badgers could make a run at things. With Ohio State and Michigan struggling early in their wins today, there may be hope yet!
