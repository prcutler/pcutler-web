It&#8217;s been over a year (a year!) since my [last post][1] about writing documentation for Foresight. In that time, we&#8217;ve shipped Foresight 2.0, and the Getting Started with Foresight User Guide has frequently been met with great feedback when Foresight is reviewed.

I&#8217;ve kept up with a few minor updates and edits to keep it fresh, but now it&#8217;s time to start planning some major updates. In no particular, I want to focus on:

  * [Banshee re-write][2]. Now that Banshee is at 1.2, the screenshots need to be updated to it&#8217;s new look, and an overview of it&#8217;s new features, including video, podcasts, Last.fm integration and internet radio.
  * [Installing Foresight][3]. [Jayson][4] was kind enough to attach some documentation and screenshots, but I didn&#8217;t find the time to incorporate them. (Hint, hint Jayson)
  * [Add a section on Liferea][5]. Write a section on Foresight&#8217;s default feedreader. Robin Groves has posted a first draft on the wiki that I need to review and edit.
  * Using GNOME-DO. As the first distribution to ship GNOME-DO, it&#8217;s a very powerful application, and new users probably need some help getting to know it.
  * [Expand the section on using PackageKit][6]. Some of the icons need to be updated as well.

But more importantly, what do you think is missing from the User Guide? What does a new user need to know? I&#8217;d love to get some feedback. Foresight&#8217;s User Guide is located in [Foresight&#8217;s Mercurial repository][7]. I&#8217;m also open to any help anyone wants to contribute! If you need help in checking it out or submitting a patch, please let me know.
