My [scheduled talk at the Penguins Unbound LUG][1] in St. Paul, MN has been moved up one week to this Saturday, November 14th at 10:00 a.m. ([Minnebar, the Minnesota Barcamp][2] was recently announced for November 21st conflicting with the meeting).

I will be presenting &#8220;An Introduction to GNOME 3.0&#8221; talking about GNOME, its history, and where GNOME is going with the upcoming GNOME 3.0 release next year. If you&#8217;re in the Minneapolis / St. Paul area come join in the fun.

I look forward to seeing you there!
