[Ubuntu Blog][1] has one of the most useful tips yet: [How to mount a remote filesystem using SSH][2].

This is going to be big for me: I can mount my different webservers, hack my Terrastation and mount that using SSH, and all my other boxen.

Why use GNOME-VFS now? SSH is much more stable.

Thanks Ubuntu Blog!
