I love the inter-webnet thing. Ok, seriously, I do.

I love Web 2.0. The applications that are being built are making my life easier.

Over on the right of this blog, I&#8217;ve had my del.icio.us bookmarks listed for sometime. As I&#8217;ve come across a new link I find interesting, I use the del.icio.us Firefox plugin to capture it. You can see the links on the right or just visit my [del.icio.us userpage][1] and see all my links.

I only use my Firefox bookmarks for stuff I visit everyday. The good news is that del.icio.us&#8217; importer is finally working, so last night I imported all my Firefox bookmarks in to it, and can use del.icio.us to manage all my bookmarks. I have to make them visible, check their tags and sort them, and I&#8217;ll be good to go.

The other thing I did this week was something I should have done a long time ago. I forwarded my two @silwenae.com email address to my Gmail account. Gmail&#8217;s spam filters are just so superior to anything else I&#8217;ve tried, that no spam gets through. I created my labels (which I still think of as tags) in Gmail, set up my filters, and away we go.

I subscribe to a lot of different mailing lists &#8211; ([Twin Cities Linux User Group][2], [Pho][3], and [Banshee][4] to name just a few. Gmail is the best at viewing mailing lists. The way it shows threads is superior to anything I&#8217;ve seen in Outlook, Thunderbird or Evolution.

And I can access it all from my mobile phone. (Not that I ever really need to, but still). And I&#8217;m looking forward [to adding my picture / avatar][5] for Gmail & Google Talk. (Now if I could just get my friends to drop MSN Messenger for Gtalk, I&#8217;d be set!)
