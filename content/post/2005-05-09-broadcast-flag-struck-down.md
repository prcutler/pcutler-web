On Fri., May 6th, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit [ruled the FCC][1] overstepped it&#8217;s bounds when it created the [Broadcast Flag][2].

[The EFF has the story][3], as well as [CNet&#8217;s News.com][4].

This is big, very big. It was unexpected, especially a unanimous decision by the Court. Congress needs to legislate, not the FCC.

My favorite quote from the judges:

> &#8220;You&#8217;re out there in the whole world, regulating. Are washing machines next?&#8221; asked Judge Harry Edwards. Quipped Judge David Sentelle: &#8220;You can&#8217;t regulate washing machines. You can&#8217;t rule the world.&#8221; 

Here&#8217;s to all the groups that opposed the travesty that was the Broadcast Flag, from the EFF article:

> The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) joined Washington DC-based advocacy group Public Knowledge in fighting the rule in the courts, together with Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America, the American Library Association, the Association of Research Libraries, the American Association of Law Libraries, the Medical Library Association, and the Special Libraries Association. The coalition argued that the rule would interfere with the legitimate activities of technology innovators, librarians, archivists, and academics, and that the FCC exceeded its regulatory authority by imposing technological restrictions on what consumers can do with television shows after they receive them.
