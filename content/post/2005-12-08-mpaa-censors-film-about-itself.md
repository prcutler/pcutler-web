How do you stop a film that exposes how the film industry assigns a rating (G, PG, PG-13, R) to a film?

[Rate the film NC-17][1]. Rating a film NC-17 stops the movie from being advertised, limits which theaters will even show it, and effectively censors the message.

The Independent Film Channel (IFC) has stepped up and will show it uncut in Fall 2006, after the film&#8217;s debut at Sundance this January.

The film industry is broken &#8211; from the hypocrisy in how it rates films to how what films are made to it&#8217;s excuses why total revenue is down. And this just highlights how Big Media continues to abuse its power.
