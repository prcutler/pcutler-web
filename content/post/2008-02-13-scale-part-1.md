I spent last week working at my office in Los Angeles so I could also attend the [Southern California Linux Expo][1] (SCALE) this past weekend. Along with Ken VanDine and Kevin Harriss, we hosted the Foresight booth on the show floor.

We also hung out with Stu, who flew in with Ken and was manning the [Bongo Project][3] booth. Not only was Stu showing off the Bongo Project, which by itself is a cool mail and calendar server and web client, he was showing a demo of it as an rPath appliance.

I attended Jono Bacon&#8217;s keynote, Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: The Coming of the Linux Desktop which was a fantastic talk. Jono is right: it&#8217;s all about the community.

I later had the chance to catch up and chat with Jono, as well, as Ken, and we talked about the community, how we can work together, and Ken&#8217;s thoughts on helping the Patch Squad and making it easy for users to do more testing and bug triaging.

I met some folks at dinner Friday night, including [Eric][5], [Christian][6] and [Jeff][7], a couple of which were also at the GNOME booth next door to Foresight at the show. Chatted with Christian briefly on a new RSS reader he just started [working on][8] for GNOME, which looks awesome.

Saturday night Ken participated in the Weakest Geek competition (based on the TV show Weakest Link), and I&#8217;m proud to say he wasn&#8217;t one of the first two voted off. It was pretty darn funny, and other contestants included Ted Haeger (formerly of Novell), Jono Bacon (Ubuntu), Jeremy (Linuxquestions.org) and two others. The questions were hilarious, and some of the answers were even funnier.

Unfortunately, I missed Karen Sandler&#8217;s talk Sunday. Karen is an officer of the [Software Freedom Conservancy][9] and gave a talk on [Legal Organizational Issues for Free Software Projects][10]. I&#8217;m really kicking myself for spacing this one and missing it.

I put up a handful of pictures in a [Flickr set][11], and [Kevin has even more][12].
