Flaming Sheep Software has released the [Classic Doom][1] mod for Doom3. Bringing back the look, feel and maps of the original Doom now running on the Doom3 engine.

Quake IV on Linux has been a breeze to run, I&#8217;m going to have to install my Doom3 copy that&#8217;s around here somewhere and try this mod out.
