A major change from Foresight 1.x to 2.0 (Beta) is the removal of proprietary codecs, which are no longer installed by default.

Depending on where you live and the legality of the codecs, users can install MP3 and DVD support via `sudo conary update group-codecs`.

You, of course, assume all legal responsibility. 🙂
