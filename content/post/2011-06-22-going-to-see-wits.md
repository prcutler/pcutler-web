This Friday, my son and I are going to the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul to see the season finale of [Minnesota Public Radio&#8217;s Wits series][1]. Each performance features an interview with a cultural icon, a musical guest and other guests. I purchased tickets for this one specifically because of the featured guest: [Neil Gaiman][2]. Mr. Gaiman is touring in support of the tenth anniversary of his first novel, the class _American Gods_.

I vividly remember the first time I read _American Gods_. I knew of Neil Gaiman through his groundbreaking comic, _Sandman_, but _American Gods_ blew me away. I remember thinking, &#8220;_How does this Englishman know of all these Midwest landmarks?!_&#8221; And when they stopped at a Culvers just outside of Madison&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t until a few years later than I learned he had relocated to Wisconsin, not too far from the Minnesota border. The book&#8217;s take on mythology and its plot quickly made it a classic.

I had the opportunity to see Neil Gaiman speak and do a book signing a few years ago when his last collection of short stories, _Fragile Things_, was published. He&#8217;s an engaging speaker and listening to him read from his stories is a thrill in itself. (I also won the raffle in support of the CBLDF):

This week&#8217;s musical guess is Josh Ritter and the hosts are John Moe of MPR and [John Munson][4]. Mr. Munson was formerly in the bands Trip Shakespeare and Semisonic. Back in (probably) 1994, for the only time in my life, I won concert tickets on the radio from [Mary Lucia][5] at [Rev105][6] to see a showcase of Minnesota acts at [First Avenue][7]. One band in particular, Pleasure, just blew me away &#8211; it was one of the tightest bands I&#8217;ve ever seen, and I didn&#8217;t know a single song. I moved out east and never heard about the band again. A year or two later, a friend from the Twin Cities moved out east to work with me, and I asked him about Pleasure. He excitedly informed me they had changed their name to Semisonic and I bought their debut album the same day. (You probably know them from their big hit, _Closing Time_).

In addition, guests at Wits this week appearing via the phone include Wil Wheaton, Adam Savage, [and more][1].

Can&#8217;t wait &#8211; both for the show and to introduce my son to seeing Neil Gaiman live.
