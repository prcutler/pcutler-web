_\* Dusts off the old blog \*_

This thing still on?  Still working?  I guess it is!  I could give you the usual excuses why I haven&#8217;t blogged much in the last few years.  The rise of Twitter, general laziness, etc.  But I might be back to blogging for a little bit.

I won&#8217;t call it a New Year&#8217;s resolution as I started it at Thanksgiving, but 2016 is the year I&#8217;m going to learn how to code.  Specifically, I&#8217;m going to learn Python.  I have an itch to scratch and a problem to solve and Python may be the solution.

I&#8217;ve worked with programmers both at my day job and various [open source organizations][1], but I don&#8217;t know how to code.  I can manipulate a little HTML and XML (Docbook), but that doesn&#8217;t mean I could do it from scratch.

Just over a month ago on Thanksgiving weekend, I decided it was time to learn Python.  I bought a few books from [O&#8217;Reilly][2] that were on sale, started a [Codecademy][3] course, and away I went.

One reason that I may not blog as much, is that I do use a journal &#8211; [Day One][4], specifically (and it&#8217;s fantastic, but that&#8217;s a different subject for another day) as I do enjoy writing.  At the same time I decided to start to learn to code, I started a new notebook in Day One (sshhh &#8211; it&#8217;s a secret new feature available to beta testers I&#8217;m not supposed to talk about&#8230;yet) to start detailing my journey into learning Python.

In the coming days, weeks, and hopefully, months I&#8217;ll be sharing those thoughts from my journal on trying to learn Python, including why, what&#8217;s working, not working and the tools I&#8217;m using.  Stay tuned for more as I begin my quest to learn Python.
