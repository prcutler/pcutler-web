Check out [Howard&#8217;s Stern website!][1]

He&#8217;s a little pissed at the Bush Administration, and urging folks to register to vote. His entire front page is dedicated to his effort.

I listened to Howard when I lived in Philadelphia, and enjoyed his show (though he has so many commericals&#8230;), and listened off and on for the brief time he was on here in Minnesota.

What&#8217;s interesting to me, is that I would assume his listener base would tend to vote Republican. This isn&#8217;t new for him, the last 6 months to a year he has been railing against the administration, especially after the Clear Channel debacle around the FCC fines when Clear Channel dropped him on a handful of stations (he&#8217;s distributed by Clear Channel&#8217;s largest competitor, Infinity).

It will be intriguing to see what impact this may or may not have on the general election.
