From the better late than never department, the [2009 GNOME Foundation Annual Report has been released][1].

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1517" title="2009 GNOME Annual Report" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.paulcutler.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Small_Cover.png?resize=197%2C250" alt="" width="197" height="250" data-recalc-dims="1" />][2]

When [Lucas][3] first asked me to help with the annual report a year and a half ago at GUADEC in Gran Canaria, one of the goals was to try and help it come out sooner. Apparently, I had the opposite effect. I have lots of excuses, but none of them good. (Though someone did point out to me that Mozilla [just released their 2009][4] report a few weeks ago, so I felt a bit better. But not a whole lot, I hate being tardy, believe it or not).

The Annual Report wouldn&#8217;t have happened without [Daniel Galleguillos C.][5] who did all of the design and layout work and put up with my constant change requests. (Thanks to those who have already found a couple small typos &#8211; please email me with any more you find and I&#8217;ll work to get an updated copy out this weekend).

Thanks to all of our writers, including Jason Clinton, Pockey Lam, Stormy Peters and Diego Escalante Urrelo &#8211; and everyone who contributed to a quarterly report. I&#8217;d also like to thank everyone who helped with photos or re-licensed their photos so we were able to use them including Cody Russell, Chris Lord, Michael Dominic K., and Lucas Rocha. Lastly, thanks to everyone who helped edit and everyone I&#8217;m forgetting (because I know I am &#8211; especially on the photos!)

Work is already beginning on the 2010 report. It will be out sooner (I promise) and I&#8217;m also going to change it so it coincides with GNOME&#8217;s fiscal year rather than calendar year, so it may be a slightly smaller as there will be some overlap. If you want to help out, let me know!
