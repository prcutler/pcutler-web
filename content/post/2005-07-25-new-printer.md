On the advice of two cow-orkers, who coincidentally had the same printer, I purchased a [Canon PIXMA iP6000D][1] today. (Canon has a crappy website, btw).

I, however, forgot to see if it has Linux drivers available. (It doesn&#8217;t).

It&#8217;s for the wife more than me, as she needed a color printer, and the sample 4&#215;6 photo I saw at the office was good. I&#8217;ve printed out 8-10 4&#215;6 photo&#8217;s after hooking it up, and it&#8217;s phenomenal. It&#8217;s amazing how far the technology has come. I printed off a bunch to hang in my cube at work. I&#8217;m quite interested in seeing how an 8&#215;10 looks.

I&#8217;ve hooked it up to Kelly&#8217;s computer, and shared it over the network so I could print from my MCPC. I have a [wireless Netgear print server][2] around here somewhere, I&#8217;ll have to give that a go.

I&#8217;m annoyed about the Linux thing though. Now I have to transfer my pictures from my main box to my MCPC to print. But the printer does have a 7-in-1 card reader, so I can always just stick the memory card in if I want, though it looks like I&#8217;d have to press a bunch of buttons on the printer which doesn&#8217;t look the most user friendly way to do it. Ah well.
