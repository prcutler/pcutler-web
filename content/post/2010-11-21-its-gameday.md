As a huge (American) football fan, it amuses me to no end how my children get into the excitement of game day. They know how much I love my football teams and want to know who the Packers (or Badgers) are playing each week, which other teams I want to win in the other games, and share my enthusiasm for the game. Jack&#8217;s knowledge of the players and the opposing teams is almost scary considering he is only 4 years old.

As a Wisconsin native living in Minnesota, they really get excited when the Green Bay Packers take on the Minnesota Vikings. (Though all real Packer fans know the real rivalry is with the Bears &#8211; a fact that Minnesotans just don&#8217;t understand. The Packer / Viking rivalry is nothing compared to that one &#8211; ask me about the time I went to a Packer / Bears game at Lambeau sometime).

So I was happy to see, that without any prompting from me, my two youngest pick out their own clothes this morning:

Now that brings a smile to my face. We&#8217;re just minutes from game time &#8211; go Pack go!
