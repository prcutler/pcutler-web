I signed up for an account at [Last.fm][1] and downloaded and installed the XMMS plug-in. (I manually downloaded the plugin from their site, and then thought to check Synaptic. Sure enough, it was in the Ubuntu repository!)

It&#8217;s pretty cool so far &#8211; after listening to only two or three different artists it already had Weezer at the top of the recommended list for me, and I&#8217;m a huge Weezer fan. It will be really interesting to see it when it really kicks in with other users in addition to just figuring out my listening habits.

If you&#8217;re really curious about my musical tastes, [you can see my Last.fm user page here][2].
