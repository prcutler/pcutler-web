This week&#8217;s random football thoughts:

  1. The Chargers&#8217; powder blue unis are the best in football
  2. Unless you are the San Diego Chargers, you should **not** wear alternate jerseys
  3. Dom Capers is sooo fired
  4. I really, really like Carson Palmer
  5. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune&#8217;s headline this morning was right on: Kick. Win. Repeat.
  6. I really do think the Colts will go undefeated.
  7. Even with Vick having 2 games in a row with a passing rating over 95, I still think he&#8217;s overrated
  8. Why are you not reading the best football article anywhere? Go read the [Tuesday Morning Quarterback][1]
