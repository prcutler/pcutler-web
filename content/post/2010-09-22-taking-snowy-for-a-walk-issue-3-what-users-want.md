We [launched][1] the [sign-ups][2] for the upcoming Tomboy Online alpha last week. As part of the sign-up process we included a brief survey asking what features those signing up were interested in and to rate them on a scale of 1 &#8211; 5, which 5 being very interested.

We asked them to rate the following features:

  * Free note synchronization for Tomboy
  * Sharing my notes so other users can read them
  * Editing my notes from my desktop web browser
  * Native Android app (Tomdroid)
  * Native iOS app
  * HTML5 offline client (for all mobile desktop browsers)
  * Editing my notes from my mobile device (browser, native app, whatever)

Here are the results:

_(If it&#8217;s hard to read, [here is link to the png file][3] too, squint really hard)_

It&#8217;s a fairly small sample, but I&#8217;m still please to see so little interest in iOS and a huge interest in Android and HTML5.

[Snowy was approved for a hackfest][4] at the Boston Summit. The hackfest goals include match up nicely with the survey results. The goals include:

  * Mobile client for accessing and syncing notes
  * Implement UI / Design via CSS
  * Implement a text editor
  * Implement note sharing between users via the web interface
  * Prepare Tomboy Online for Beta release

And if there are any companies that want to help sponsor the hackfest, please let me or Stormy know!

We&#8217;re excited to be working on a web service that integrates with the GNOME Desktop. We have one bug to fix that&#8217;s delayed the alpha launch slightly. Thanks to everyone who has signed up and we&#8217;ll get the invites out ASAP.
