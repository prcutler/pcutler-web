A topic near and dear to my heart, which I&#8217;ve [covered before][1], is the FCC & the [Broadcast Flag][2].

The American Library Assoc. was [in court this week][3], challenging the FCC on the legality of the Broadcast Flag. The 3 judge panel, [while questioning if the ALA even has the right to bring a legal challenge][4], [hammered][5] the FCC [on the FCC&#8217;s ability][6] to mandate this without legislation from Congress. We&#8217;ll know the court&#8217;s ruling [in a few months][7].

You can also read a blog with [detailed coverage as the blogger attends in court.][8]
