Badgers & Packers both win big this weekend.

With the exception of 2 minutes in the 2nd half, the Badgers were dominating, even with 3 defensive starters out.

Packers looked simply awesome (where have they been all year?!) &#8211; Grady Jackson was back stuffing the run and knocking down a pass, the secondary looked good, and the offense looked awesome. Go Go Javon and Ahman!

Badgers are off this weekend, and the Packers are at the Redskins. I need to look in to that whole superstition about the Redskins and Presidential picks, and make sure the Packers get to win.
