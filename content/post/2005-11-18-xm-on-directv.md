The long-promised XM channels have finally shown up on DirecTV. Over 50 different channels covering all types of music. (How many does XM offer on their paid subscription? &#8211; Ok, I checked, over 150).

Stations include the Squizz, Fred & Ethel, so I&#8217;m definitely set. Then you have your standards, like 80&#8217;s, pop, rock, a few R&B stations.

What&#8217;s nice, is similar to DirecTV&#8217;s last music service, Music Choice, is each song pops up with some text on the TV screen showing you artist, song, album, year, etc.

With no extra cost to me as a DirecTV subscriber, I can&#8217;t complain, and I&#8217;ll use &#8217;em from time to time.
