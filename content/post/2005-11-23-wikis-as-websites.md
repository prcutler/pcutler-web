One of the latest trends in open-source development, is for the projects website to be created with [MediaWiki][1].

[This article][2] on Acts of Volition lists a couple others, as well as one of my current favorite pieces of software, [Banshee][3], a music management and player for GNOME. (I&#8217;ve been meaning to blog about Banshee for well over a month).

I still have to put a long term plan together on integrating silwenae .com/.net/.org, and MediaWiki might address it. I don&#8217;t need all of the power of a Drupal, WordPress is already running my blog, Jinzora will power my music, and Flickr does my photos. I just need something sticky enough to link it all together.

I went and installed MediaWiki on the [Apatheia.org website][4] to see if the guild had any interest in using it as a tool. I&#8217;ve long thought it might help facilitate guildmembers signing up for a raid, managing rosters, etc, as the guildmembers themselves could update it, and you&#8217;re not reliant on one webmaster or officer to step up.

I integrated [this hack][5] to use logins from the guild forums into the Wiki, which was quite helpful. And my lack of knowledge around PHP & CSS started to show as I spend two hours last night, just playing with the header image. There aren&#8217;t a lot of good tutorials on creating a skin &#8211; especially one with a Novell-type flavor that utilizes a Wiki as a normal website. I came across [this one][6], but it was pretty darn high level, and didn&#8217;t even go into the PHP elements.

I&#8217;m going to tinker with it, especially the navigation pieces and see what happens. I&#8217;m also curious from a social networking experiment to see if any guildmembers latch on to it.
