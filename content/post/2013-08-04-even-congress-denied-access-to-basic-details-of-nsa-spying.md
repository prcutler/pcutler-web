[Via BoingBoing][1] and [The Guardian][2]: 

GOP and Democratic Congressmen have been denied information from the House Intelligence Committee on details of NSA spying. When they ask for information on how the Committee voted, the Committee won&#8217;t tell them the details of the vote or how other House members voted. It is supposedly &#8220;classified&#8221;. These Congressmen are being asked to vote on continuing to fund NSA operations and can&#8217;t even get the information they need to make a vote based on the facts.

This is absolutely ridiculous.
