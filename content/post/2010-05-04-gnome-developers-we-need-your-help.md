The Marketing Hackfest kicked off a few hours ago and we need your help.

As we build the marketing plan for the GNOME 3.0 release one of the focus areas we want to talk to users about is GNOME apps.

Do you work on a GNOME application and have some cool features planned?  Updated user interface?  Something cool to tell GNOME users that you&#8217;d like to see included in the the GNOME 3.0 marketing?  Tell us!  Leave a comment here, add to the [Roadmap on the wiki][1] or email the [marketing list][2].

Being an avid reader of Planet GNOME I&#8217;ve heard about Tomboy Online (in Beta hopefully for 3.0), collaboration in gedit and more.  Now is a great time to let the Marketing team know with what&#8217;s going on with the apps you work on and where they&#8217;re going so we can include that information as we work on our marketing plans.

We need your help!  And thank you in advance.
