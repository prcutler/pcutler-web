We are now one day away from the GNOME 2.18 release! If you didn&#8217;t download and test GNOME 2.18 yet (as I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post), [Phoronix has posted some GNOME 2.18 screenshots][1] from the GNOME / Foresight 2.18 LiveCD for your viewing pleasure.

Take a look at some screenshots, and get ready for the release.

In related GNOME news, the newly revamped GNOME website won&#8217;t be ready for 2.18 &#8211; but [give us a month][2] and we&#8217;ll have it ready for GNOME 2.18.1.
