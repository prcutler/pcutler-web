Aaron Swartz, co-creator of RSS, practically a co-founder of Reddit, and an early contributor to the Creative Commons architecture, committed suicide in New York City yesterday.

If you don&#8217;t know who Aaron is, you owe it to yourself to read obituaries from [Cory Doctorow][2] and [Declan McCullagh][3]. RIP Aaron.
