If you&#8217;re an NFL fan, Len Pasquarelli of ESPN.com has a [must read article on what they&#8217;re calling today: Bloody Thursday][1]. His [follow-up article][2] on what will go down to today is just as good.

With the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Player&#8217;s Union and Owners set to expire tomorrow, teams must get under the salary cap &#8211; a cap number they still don&#8217;t know. Free Agency starts tomorrow, and 2007 will be an uncapped year, so teams will be reluctant to sign anyone, especially as they can only pro-rate contracts over 4 years instead of the typical 7, which drives a player&#8217;s salary cap number through the roof.

Will an 11th hour deal arrive and save the league? Are we a year away from no college draft? Will the owners lock the players out after next season?

In the next 36 hours, watch the drama unfold!
