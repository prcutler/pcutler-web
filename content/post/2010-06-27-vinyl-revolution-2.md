    When I was 17 or18 years old, I wanted to be a DJ with a friend of mine. I grabbed all of my parents vinyl records, trucked them over to my friend&#8217;s house and then&#8230; we didn&#8217;t do anything. He and I eventually had a falling out and a couple years later when I inquired about getting the records back, I was dismayed to learn that his basement had flooded and they were trashed.

    I don&#8217;t think my father has forgiven me to this day.

    I grew up heavily influenced by music, including my parents listening to their records and favorite artists such as ABBA, Billy Joel and Elton John. I remember periods of my life based on the music I was listening to at the time and if I hear a specific song it can take me back right to that moment.

    I&#8217;ve been thinking about buying a turntable for the last few years and re-creating some of those memories. I participated in <a href="http://www.recordstoreday.com/Home">Record Store Day</a> last year shopping at a <a href="http://www.electricfetus.com/">local store</a> and picking up a number of CDs and this year on Record Store Day I went out and this time picked up some <a href="http://www.downinthevalley.com/">used and new vinyl records</a> and then bought a turntable off Craigslist. (An early 80s Pioneer direct-drive).

    I&#8217;m one of growing number of people getting back into vinyl &#8211; just visit <a href="http://futureofvinyl.com/">The Future of Vinyl blog</a> for non-stop <a href="http://www.creativedeconstruction.com/2009/06/resurgence-of-vinyl-could-be-just-what-the-music-industry-needs/">media</a> <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1702369,00.html#ixzz0XCmdjMU3">coverage</a> of the growth of vinyl over the last couple years &#8211; it&#8217;s now the fastest growing segment of the (dying) music industry. Even <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5229996/best-buy-may-start-selling-vinyl-records">large retailers like Best Buy</a> are getting in on it. (Though I found their selection disappointing &#8211; very few new records, just 180g re-issues of older material, and for the same prices as the local stores, who I would rather support).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I own more CDs than I can count, and even if it&#8217;s in my head, I do think vinyl sounds better. There is something to be said for the crackle and hiss of a well worn and loved album playing on a stereo.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s more fun &#8211; listening to the albums or shopping for them. I&#8217;ve already bought over 60 records in the last 6 weeks, the bulk of them at two events. The first was a private collector who put an ad in Craigslist and was selling over 5000 records with most of them going for 3 for a dollar. The second sale was today at the <a href="http://www.mnrecordshow.com/record_show_main/the_record_show.html">Minnesota Record Show</a> which is held four times a year and features a number of dealers selling records for a few bucks each to rare albums worth hundreds of dollars. On average at an event like this or in the local record stores, used albums are about $3 each. I have bought a few re-issues on 180 gram vinyl of some of my favorite albums of all time, such as Depeche Mode&#8217;s Music for the Masses. (Most albums are 120 grams &#8211; the thicker the album the higher the fidelity).

    But what impresses me the most is the resurgence in current artists releasing vinyl day and date with CD &#8211; and including MP3 or FLAC downloads for free when you purchase the vinyl record. I&#8217;ve picked up some great new albums, including the latest from <a href="http://www.bluecollardistro.com/theholdsteady/categories.php?cPath=237">The Hold Steady</a>, <a href="http://www.matadorrecords.com/store/index.php?catalog_id=480">The New Pornographers</a> and <a href="http://www.sonymusicdigital.com/broken-bells/pages/5437030/">Broken Bells</a>.

    My wife laughs at me every time I say &#8220;I&#8217;m going downstairs to listen to some records&#8221; but I&#8217;m enjoying the experience immensely. She also says I&#8217;m done collecting for a while, but don&#8217;t tell her, I have my eyes on some more new releases and I heard about another upcoming show&#8230;
