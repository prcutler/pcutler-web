Today&#8217;s quote of the day, from a Page 2 article on ESPN.com looking at the last 10 teams to start the season 10-0. The quote is from the last paragraph of the article:

[ESPN.com: Page 2 : Ten and oh and then &#8230;][1]
  
In 1998, Broncos backup QB Bubby Brister&#8217;s 99.0 QB rating was higher than John Elway&#8217;s. Brister, who was an ace sub for the injured Elway early in the season, completed 78 of 131 passes (59.5 percent) for 986 yards and 10 TDs. Brister also outran Elway, carrying 19 times for 102 yards. (Elway finished with 94 yards rushing.) According to Sports Illustrated, Brister motivated his teammates in the huddle by saying, &#8220;All right, [expletive], I&#8217;m not John, so get your asses in gear.&#8221;
