In Milwaukee, leaving in a few hours.

Think I&#8217;ll stop at [Kopps][1] for lunch and have one of the greasiest burgers money can buy. Reminds me of when I first started working for Best Buy and ate at the Kopps across the street from the Southridge store. And don&#8217;t get me started on the custard&#8230;

Camera is ready, Flickr is purchased, digital imaging software is installed on my gaming PC (what blasphemy &#8211; productivity software installed on my gaming PC, and it&#8217;s M$ software at that).

Should be fun.
