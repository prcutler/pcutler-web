  I&#8217;ve joined the podcasting revolution, and am now downloading podcasts like a madman. Shown here are <a href="http://ipodder.sourceforge.net">iPodder</a> on Ubuntu, and the new <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2005/06/17-monopod/read">Monopod</a>, a much more simpler and user friendly podcasting client. Both are running on Ubuntu Hoary.
</p>

I had a really tough time last weekend trying to get Monopod 0.2 to work, and this is 0.3 (I had to install a bunch of dev stuff). iPodder was ok, it&#8217;s the latest release that came out this week, but you have to chmod one file before it will work.

My two favorite podcasts so far are:

[Acts of Volition][1] and [MAKE Magazine&#8217;s Podcast][2].

More to come, and a rant about my MP3 player.
