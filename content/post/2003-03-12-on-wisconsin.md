And the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee keeps up the tradition this year of winning their conference. That makes 3: Marquette winning Conference-USA, UW winning the Big 10, and UWM winning the Horizon. And Bo wins Coach of the Year again in the Big 10!

And this weekend I can just sit on my butt and watch the Big 10 and Conf-USA tournaments. What a way to spend the last weekend before the big tourney!
