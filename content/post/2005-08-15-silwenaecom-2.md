Silwenae.com is 100% back to normal. All the data, links and information have been migrated to Apatheia.org. My last to-do is to update the header on the forums, but other than that, Fazin did an awesome job.

Now it&#8217;s time to start thinking about the new silwenae.com.

If I don&#8217;t have time to update my blog, I&#8217;ll have to figure out how to find time for web development again!
