It&#8217;s here, a day early even. Here are some random thoughts & first impressions of the [Dell 2405 24&#8243; LCD Widescreen Monitor][1]:

  * It&#8217;s bright. Much brighter than the Sony 21&#8243; CRTs I&#8217;ve been used to.
  * It was a snap to set up physically. (Hmm, bad pun). Snap the base into the screen, and voila. 
  * The base is quite sturdy. I don&#8217;t think the cats jumping off the window ledge will knock it over.
  * Thanks to Bernd Paysan&#8217;s [Dell 2405 web page][2] for the correct scanlines to use in Linux. (Courtesy of [Google][3]). 
  * 1920&#215;1200 resolution rocks.
  * I need to get a DVD playing ASAP. Just for kicks.
  * I&#8217;m not used to feeling like I&#8217;m sitting so far back, even though it&#8217;s just the monitor pushed back farther on the desk.
  * I&#8217;ll have to keep my desk clean now that I have all this extra space. (No, really).
  * I&#8217;ll be able to hear my speakers again as my monitor isn&#8217;t blocking them.
  * Coding web pages and stuff will be fun with multiple windows.
  * I can&#8217;t believe I bought something from Dell.
  * I can&#8217;t believe none of Dell&#8217;s competitors can compete. The nearest monitor even close to this was a Sony 24&#8243; at $1800. Buying a Dell became a no brainer.
  * The 9 in one flash card reader is a very cool feature on the side of the monitor. And the 4 USB ports.
  * Even better, [Ubuntu][4] recognized them without any prompts.
  * Need to post the pictures. ([And done][5])
  * No burned out / dead pixels
  * When scrolling this blog really fast, I get some motion blur on background on the far left, but you really have to look for it
  * UT2k4 in 1920&#215;1200 is jaw droppingly gorgeous.
  * No noticeable motion blur in UT2k4. Get sucked right in and you dont&#8217; even notice it&#8217;s an LCD anymore.
  * I should probably go boot into Windows and check performance. But I&#8217;m lazy.
  * Dell&#8217;s customer service still sucks. After the hard drive return process I went through last year, it&#8217;s not any better. The hoops I had to go through over the weekend, after I made the purchase, just to find out if it shipped with a DVI cable, were ludicrous.
  * It ships with a DVI cable, FYI
