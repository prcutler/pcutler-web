Banshee 0.98.2 is out! [Read the release notes][1], and [check out Planet Banshee for the developer&#8217;s comments][2] on the new functionality.

What&#8217;s new? VIDEO. Yup, you read that right. Your favorite audio manager is now a full fledged media manager.

I&#8217;ve been using the Banshee Preview for a few weeks, and this latest release for almost a week, and it works great. Import your music or video, and watch it right in Banshee. And if you&#8217;re listening to music, click the Now Playing button for some great visualizations.

A big shout out to Will Farrington for writing the recipe, which I committed last night to the Foresight repositories. Search for `banshee-1` in PackageKit, or install via sudo conary update `banshee-1=@fl:2-qa` Enjoy!

(And thanks to the Banshee devs for giving me credit for helping write the release notes, but I really didn&#8217;t deserve it. I started &#8217;em with a copy / paste of 0.98.1, and some other minor edits, but didn&#8217;t get a chance to really finish it). Gotta love the Foresight mention right in the release notes though!
