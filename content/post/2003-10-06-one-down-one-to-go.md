Caught the Badgers on Yahoo Radio this weekend. Good win, but they should have been able to stop Penn State better.

On to Ohio State this weekend at Camp Randall. I&#8217;ll be there with bells on!

The Packer game was absolutely beautful yesterday. Had a chance to to walk around Lambeau, saw the Atrium, which is gorgeous. The weather was awesome &#8211; 55 degrees, sunny, not a cloud in sight. And the Pack dominated Coach Holmgren&#8217;s Seahawks. Too bad 4 of the 5 touchdowns were on the far side of the field from me. <img src='https://i2.wp.com/www.silwenae.net/blogs/img/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=700' alt='&#58;&#41;' class='middle' data-recalc-dims="1" />

So one undefeated team down, and one to go&#8230; the Chiefs. Dante Hall has to be my pick for MVP so far this season. Let&#8217;s hope the Chiefs are looking past the Pack. I&#8217;ll be there again for another full football weekend! Go Pack!
