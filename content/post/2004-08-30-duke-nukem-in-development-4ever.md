Some Choice Quotes from the timeline:

Janurary 1997: Work on DNF started.*

Late 1999: 3DR announces upgrade to UT level tech. It is expected to take two weeks. 3DR releases a Christmas card saying that DNF will be released in 2000.

Unknown 2002: Broussard states that DNF will definitely be out before DooM 3.

Late 2003/early 2004: Take 2 complains about DNF development and expects it around &#8220;late 2005&#8221;. &#8220;At this point we&#8217;re just hoping the team [in garland] will finish the project.&#8221;
