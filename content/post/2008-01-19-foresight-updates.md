My blog has been quiet lately (darn work making me travel!). Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s been going on in the world of Foresight:

  * Work on the updated Userguide continues. A [Foresight-Docs mailing list was created on Google Groups][1]. Japanese translation [is almost complete][2]!
  * The marketing team has kicked off a discussion about the new Foresight website. What sites do you like? What do you not like? Add your thoughts, and [join the discussion][3].
  * [Planet Foresight][4] has re-launched, leaving Django behind, and now using Venus, a fork of Planet. [Smerp gives an overview][5] of Venus, and how he used rBuilder to create the appliance and how it can be customized. (Anyone out there up for creating a Foresight theme?)
  * The first Focus meeting occurred. Focus is a Foresight steering committee. I created a [wiki page for it][6] and [published the meeting minutes][7]. Congratulations to Eric Lake and Will Farrington, the first to be formally approved through the new process.
  * The [download page][8] links are fixed. Oops!
  * PackageKit errors are much more verbose now. Have you noticed? Fedora interviews Richard Hughes, PackageKit&#8217;s maintainer, who gives a [nice shout out to Foresight:][9]
  
    > Has their been interest from other distributions about incorporating this?

    > RH: Much. PackageKit is shipped by default in Foresight Linux and the GNOME Developer Kit. There&#8217;s also interest from Ubuntu, openSUSE, openSolaris, Mandriva, OpenMOKO and a few more that we can&#8217;t announce yet.

  * There was a marketing meeting this past Wednesday, which I will be publishing the minutes of this weekend. More of a status update, we will be deploying more appliances, including Mercurial, and best of all, a new forum! [Jive Software][10] has provided us with a free unlimited license as an open source project, and we&#8217;ll also be deploying [Crowd][11] to manage single sign on between Jive, JIRA and Confluence. Cross your fingers, we should have it up mid to late February. 

Rumor is, an Alpha 3 release should be on the way shortly too.
