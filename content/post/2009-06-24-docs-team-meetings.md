The Docs team is having two meetings in the next week &#8211; a community Q&A session tomorrow, and a project meeting this Sunday. More details on our shiny new [blog][1] at <http://blogs.gnome.org/docs/2009/06/24/upcoming-documentation-june-meetings/> (Thanks Olav for adding us to news.gnome.org!)

Speaking of our shiny new blog, does anyone know how to add additional authors to a blog on blogs.gnome.org? I haven&#8217;t been able to figure it out and I&#8217;d like to add Shaun. Is it a setting that&#8217;s right under my nose and I just don&#8217;t see it? Thanks!
