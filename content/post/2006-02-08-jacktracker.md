For you 24 fans out there (and I&#8217;m a raving one):

Introducing the [Jacktracker][1]. Using Google Maps, Flickr, and other tools, some enterprising fans have put together a history of all the hotspots in L.A. Jack has visited in 5 seasons of 24. Click on the map points to get a history lesson, and zoom in with Google maps.

Very, very cool fan made tool.
