I haven&#8217;t used Ubuntu in over two and a half years, but I&#8217;ve been watching the debate raging with the launch of Ubuntu One last week with interest.

In my opinion, the [best commentary on the matter so far has been by Jim Campbell][1], an Ubuntu member, on his blog. I encourage you to read his take on it, and also the second comment posted.
