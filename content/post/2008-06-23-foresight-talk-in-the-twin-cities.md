I&#8217;ll be giving a talk on [Foresight][1] at the end of July at a relatively new LUG in the Twin Cities, [Penguins Unbound][2].

I&#8217;ve met a few Foresight users in IRC that live in the Twin Cities over the next year. I hope you&#8217;ll come out and we can meet in person. Hope to see you there!

More information is [available here][3].
