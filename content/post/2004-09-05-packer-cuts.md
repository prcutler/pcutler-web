Today&#8217;s the day the Packers have to get to the NFL mandated 53 player roster.

The only roster spots I&#8217;m really interested in:

Cut Couch. He&#8217;s not the QB of the future. Cut your losses now.

Keep Sander. He&#8217;s kicked pretty darn bad, but only keep 2 QBs, keep Barker for the first 4 weeks of the season, then cut Barker and keep Sander.

Keep Cullen Jenkins.

Keep Scottie Vines, cut Carl Ford (poor Carl, after such a great camp a year ago too).

I won&#8217;t touch the defensive line, too hard to call.

Good move trading Marques Anderson.

Be back later today to see how I did with my crystal ball.
