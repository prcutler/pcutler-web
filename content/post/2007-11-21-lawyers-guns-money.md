Unreal Tournament 3 was released Monday. But the Linux client demo never appeared, and the Linux retail server and client haven&#8217;t appeared yet either.

The UT3 mailing list has also been quiet recently, but last night Icculus sent a tweet out and the news hit the mailing list soon after: [UT3&#8217;s Linux bits are hung up in legal][1]. Somewhere along the way Epic licensed some middleware that can&#8217;t be included in the Linux version. Hopefully we&#8217;ll get some more news soon.

In related news, no Gears of War for Linux, only Mac. Something about the publisher who is based in Redmond squashing that idea. Damn them.
