Did anyone besides me watch the NFL preseason show tonight on ABC?

Britney Spears had to do the worst lip-syncing I&#8217;ve ever seen. At one point, she is trying to put the mic on a mic stand while putting a glove on her hand. Her voice / inflection never changed as her head moved back and forth from the mic.

She really looked like she wasn&#8217;t even trying. And at the end when she thanked the crowd, there was an almost noticeable pop from turning the mic on.
