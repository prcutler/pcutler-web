I&#8217;ve upgraded 3 of my main machines to [Ubuntu][1] 5.04, aka the Hoary Hedgehog release. The laptop went flawlessly, as did my gaming machine, which is installed on a second hard drive. Most impressively, the ATI binary drivers, with the change to X.org, stayed and worked on my gaming box automagically. OpenGL is beautiful, the fonts are beautiful, and I&#8217;ve switched to the Clearlooks theme from Industrial.

My two major complaints are the Industrial theme disappearing and they&#8217;ve changed Nautilus&#8217; spatial nature. Clearlooks is acceptable as a replacement, but I don&#8217;t understand why they&#8217;ve had to go and screw with Nautilus. Gnome&#8217;s default behavior for Nautilus is to open every window in a new window. **I like it that way**. Ubuntu, being a Gnome-centric distribution, and dedicated to releasing after every major Gnome release, should follow that direction. I can understand why some people don&#8217;t like it, but it strikes me as odd they&#8217;ve made this change.

Only the server is left to upgrade, and based on the 3 upgrades I&#8217;ve done from Warty to Hoary, should go flawless. Then it&#8217;s a matter of getting the server up on the network, which is a different story after my network rebuild last weekend.
