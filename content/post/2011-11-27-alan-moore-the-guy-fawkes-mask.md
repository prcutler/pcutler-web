[Alan Moore talk to The Guardian][1] about V for Vendetta and the use of the Guy Fawkes mask he created for V for Vendetta and its use by Occupy.

> It is an irony noted with relish by critics of the protests – one also glumly acknowledged by many of the protesters – that the purchase of so many _Vendetta _masks has become a lucrative little side-earner for Time Warner, the media company that owns the rights to Moore&#8217;s creation. Efforts have been made to avoid feeding the conglomerate more cash, the Anonymous group reportedly starting to [import masks][2] direct from factories in China to circumvent corporate pockets; last year, demonstrators at a &#8220;Free Julian Assange&#8221; event in Madrid wore cardboard replicas, apparently self-made. But more than 100,000 of the £4-£7 masks sell every year, according to the manufacturers, with a cut always going to Time Warner. Does that irk Moore?

> &#8220;I find it comical, watching Time Warner try to walk this precarious tightrope.&#8221; Through contacts in the comics industry, he explains, he has heard that boosted sales of the masks have become a troubling issue for the company. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bit embarrassing to be a corporation that seems to be profiting from an anti-corporate protest. It&#8217;s not really anything that they want to be associated with. And yet they really don&#8217;t like turning down money – it goes against all of their instincts.&#8221; Moore chuckles. &#8220;I find it more funny than irksome.&#8221;

Oh, poor Time Warner and your moral dilemmas.  If only that was the least of your troubles.
