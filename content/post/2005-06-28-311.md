Sheesh, I [mention the other day][1] how I&#8217;ve gotten in to podcasting in a big way, and then Apple goes and makes it mainstream just to copy me (no, really!).

Apple&#8217;s iTunes 4.9 now has Podcasting support. Windows users can download Apple&#8217;s iTunes 4.9 [here][2]. Suppose I should fire up the old Mac Mini and take a look.

And for the record, I&#8217;ve been downloading podcasts for the last year intermittently, and burning them to CD for long car rides. Just hadn&#8217;t done the whole automated thing.
