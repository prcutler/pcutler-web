The [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees have been announced][1] for 2011.  While there are a few good nominees, including the Beastie Boys, Neil Diamond and Tom Waits, there are the not so good.  That list would include Bon Jovi, the J. Geils Band and Donna Summer.  While each of them have contributed to the history of rock & roll, let&#8217;s put them in perspective of some of the groups and artists [snubbed by the Hall of Fame][2]:

  * Peter Gabriel
  * Depeche Mode
  * Black Flag
  * The Replacements
  * Rush

When you consider that list, especially with Rush having been snubbed for over 10 years now, the Hall of Fame needs to re-visit their process.  It will be interesting to see who is actually inducted in a few weeks.
