In last week&#8217;s Focus meeting, the Focus council approved three new members to Foresight:

  * [Jordan Keyes][1] (jkeyes0)
  * [Lance Haig][2] (lancehaig)
  * [Tomas Forsman][3] (Zinden)

I&#8217;d like to welcome them as official members to the community, and add a few words:

  * Jordan is a relatively new user to Foresight, and has been involved with packaging. In addition to Eric Lake, Jordan has also participated in Foresight advocacy with his local LUG in Kentucky.
  * Lance Haig, a [Bongo][4] developer, got his start with Conary as the owner of the [Bongo appliance on rBuilder][5]. Lance has contributed packages to Foresight, notably virt-manager, a GUI for managing virtual machines with KVM.
  * Tomas aka Zinden, has been an active member of Foresight&#8217;s community in IRC and the forums, and has been an active advocate of Foresight in Sweden in helping Foresight gain new users, helping those users and managing a Swedish Foresight website.

What does it take to become an official Foresight member? Visit the [wiki page][6] for more, but we&#8217;re looking for contributors who have sustained participation within Foresight for a few months, whether it&#8217;s packaging, documentation, marketing or more. Benefits include a customized hostmask on Freenode IRC, @foresightlinux.org email address, and having your blog syndicated on [Planet Foresight][7]. But best of all, it&#8217;s about the recognition of having helped Foresight and it&#8217;s community.

Think you have what it takes? [Apply here][8], and make sure your personal wiki page on the [Foresight wiki][9] is updated with a list of your contributions and what you would like to accomplish in the future.

Once you&#8217;re a member, you can [apply to be a developer][10], and eventually gain commit access to the Foresight repositories.
