Turn your laptop into a hangable, on the wall, picture frame.

[It has to be seen to be believed][1]. Disassemble your laptop, mount it to a picture frame, and just follow the step by step instructions.

Think about it if he wasn&#8217;t using XP: you could take some really, really old laptops that can be had cheap and do a bunch of them using say, free software like Linux. 🙂

Nevertheless, a very cool hacking project.
