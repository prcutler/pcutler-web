## 10 guys. 6 Xbox Ones. And Titanfall. {.subtitle}

Titanfall was released last week. The first true blockbuster release for the Xbox One has been met with great reviews and huge anticipation by Xbox One owners.

And it delivers.

I&#8217;m not going to go into the gameplay or a review, there are plenty of those available on the web. But I will say, just as Halo was the first blockbuster and reason to own the original Xbox, Titanfall is the same for Xbox One.

We had friends coming up from Austin to spend the weekend, and Jason was kind enough to offer to host. So they brought their Xbox Ones, we picked up some extra TVs, and we had guys coming and going all weekend for some Titanfall fun. (I could only be there Thursday and Friday).
