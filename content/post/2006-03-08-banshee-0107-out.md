[Banshee 0.10.7 is out][1], and already uploaded to Ubuntu Dapper Drake. (More on my Dapper Drake experiences this weekend, I promise!)

Finally, genre is an available column (yay!) despite Aaron&#8217;s protests. 0.10.7 also makes the full time switch to gstreamer 0.10.

I&#8217;ve been playing with it, and after one hiccup on Dapper Drake, it works flawlessly. Banshee is definitely my music player of chocie.
