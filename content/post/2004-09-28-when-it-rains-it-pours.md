A week and half ago, [I purchased Fable and NHL2k5 for my X-box][1]. I&#8217;ve probably played 10-12 games of hockey, and having a blast doing it &#8211; even if on Pro I&#8217;m still winning too many, even if by only 1 goal.

I haven&#8217;t played Fable as near as much as I&#8217;ve wanted due to two things:

> 1. Was traveling
  
> 2. It&#8217;s a M rated game &#8211; as I found out after I started playing it. And Alex likes watching me play way too much for him to see me playing a role playing game as I hack away at the bad guys.

So I had received a gift card last week, and after trying out [Farcry][2] at Kent&#8217;s a week or two ago, decided to pick it up, as I enjoy a good FPS. After the fun I had playing [Call of Duty][3] single-player a year after everyone else, I decided this could be a good fit. So I bought it today. Come back to the office, and get more presents: [Rome: Total War][4], a new real time strategy getting good reviews, and [Star Wars: Battlefront][5] (Warning: flash site) for the PC.

Considering I&#8217;ll be wiring the basement this weekend, in Orlando the following weekend, in Chicago after that, then at Lambeau the weekend after for the Cowboys game, when will I find the time? I still have Fable to play, my NFL2k5 football and hockey seasons, and two beta&#8217;s, including WoW to test. I&#8217;ve barely caught up on my TiVO from the last week or two, and here we go again&#8230; Good thing I haven&#8217;t bought X-Men from Raven yet! And I haven&#8217;t even thought about practicing for the BFG lan competition.

When it rains, it pours.
