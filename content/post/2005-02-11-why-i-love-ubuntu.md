I installed Ubuntu on another computer today &#8211; my gaming box.

Threw in a 20 gig HD I had laying around, threw in the install disc, and 20 minutes later had a fully functioning dual-boot system.

This will enable me to get back to one of my goals &#8211; learning PHP and dedicating 2 nights a week to it. Pulled up synaptic, installed screem & bluefish, and I&#8217;m ready to go!

I even installed gnome-blog so I can blog to my hearts content right from my desktop.

In 20 minutes I had a fully functioning linux install, up to date with all security fixes, and patches necessary. Apt-get a few things, had MP3 working and I was surfing away.

My only 2 complaints: This brown theme does nothing for me, thoguh I love Gnome&#8217;s Industrial theme. And ran into my first major Ubuntu bug. I&#8217;m running an Intel 865 chipset board, using the onboard sound. Sound works in Gnome, but a few of the games I installed have no sound. Must be an ALSA / OSS thing. I tried installing a few ALSA plugins, but no luck yet. I&#8217;ll have to throw Doom3 or UT2k4 on here and see how it fares.
