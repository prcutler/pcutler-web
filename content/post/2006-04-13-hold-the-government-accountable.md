[Wired has an article up][1] discussing AT&T&#8217;s attempts to get back 140 pages of documents given to the EFF by a whistleblower.

The EFF is suing AT&T based on AT&T&#8217;s efforts to assist the NSA in tapping phone calls.

If half what the whistleblower says is true, the government needs to be held accountable for this gross breach of civil liberties. Wiretapping and providing information to the government for U.S. citizens is expressly forbidden by law &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t seem to stop the NSA or the current administration.
