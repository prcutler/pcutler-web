[Ubuntu Linux 5.04][1] (Hoary Hedgehog release) is out!

Go [download it!][2]

Ubuntu has, by far, become my favorite linux distribution. Releasing stable version of [Debian][3] every 6 months, with the latest version of the [Gnome desktop][4], an awesome user community, and a great selection of software.

The Hoary Hedgehog release adds X.org for the xserver, faster boot process, much better laptop support, and what I think may be a first for a Linux distribution, automated package manager download and installer to upgrade the OS. Check it:

> Ubuntu 5.04 includes two new packages to help you keep your computer up to date: update-manager and upgrade-notifier. The Synaptic package manager also now includes support to upgrade your Ubuntu Distribution.
  
> update-manager is a package that allows you to quickly and efficiently upgrade your software in the background. The process is simple but without the fine-grained choices offered with the Synaptic package manager. The package is good for people who like the simplicity of a one-click upgrade, similar to that available in other operating systems. 

[Read the Release notes here][5].

I know what I&#8217;ll be doing this weekend: Upgrading 5 machines to Hoary, including my server. (My original plan was to get the server back up on the DMZ and get [Jinzora][6] working. Ack).
