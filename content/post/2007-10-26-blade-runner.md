I&#8217;ve [previously][1] [mentioned][2] my enthusiasm for [Blade Runner][3] (interesting, but horrible, flash website), and was happy to see ([via the Digital Bits][4]) today that the Final Cut will be opening in Minneapolis on Nov. 30th at the Uptown Theater. I originally saw Blade Runner when the Director&#8217;s Cut was screened in 1992 in Milwaukee, and you can count on me being at the Uptown to see this final version.

The Final Cut&#8217;s December release has me seriously considering getting a Blu-Ray player, the first film to do so.
