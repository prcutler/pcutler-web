I upgraded Ubuntu on [my laptop][1] from Colony 3 to Preview 1. I&#8217;m finally wireless again &#8211; it&#8217;s something to sit on the couch in front of the TV and surf (and blog). I needed to get everything running for my trip this weekend so I can blog the LAN party and upload the pictures in real time to [Flickr][2].

My wireless settings for Centrino weren&#8217;t working on Colony 3, but a quick apt-get upgrade and double checking my ESSID and WEP and everything is up and running again.

What a change from Hoary &#8211; getting Centrino support was a bear and then some. From upgrading the firmware and the drivers, this time it was just a matter of activating it.

Now I have to find the instructions somewhere on the net to get the pretty blue light working again when the wireless is on. 🙂
