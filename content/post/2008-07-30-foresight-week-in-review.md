What a week last week turned out to be for Foresight!

In no particular order:

  * The [first newletter][1] in months came out, and we enter year two of the newsletter. Hopefully I&#8217;m back in the swing of things and will get that released on time every month.
  * [Foresight 2.0.4 was released][2]. And not just any release, a single CD install disc (the [Foresight GNOME Lite Edition][3]) is now available! It removes most languages, and is 32 bit only. No more 2 CD installs, and this one uses the tar based installer, so installation should be under 10 minutes. And it&#8217;s easy to upgrade to the full version!
  * [Foresight officially joined][4] the [Software Freedom Conservancy][5]. This is big for us &#8211; we now have the flexibility of being a non-profit organization. We can take donations, and use that money to help spread the word and market Foresight. It will help us get to more conferences, and create promotional material, whether that&#8217;s flyers or install discs to hand out. [Donate today!][6] (I did!)

One last note, this week&#8217;s Foresight Council meeting has been moved up a day, from Friday to Thursday at 9 a.m. EST in #foresight-council on Freenode IRC.
