I&#8217;ve been meaning for a while to blog about Mozilla&#8217;s [Firefox][1] . A week or two back they released 1.0 Preview Release 1, and it blew away their previous version. The built-in RSS reader is worth it alone.

Tabbed browsing, built-in Google search bar, built-in pop-up blocking, and most of all, speed. This is true innovation in software development.

They had a goal of 1 million downloads in 10 days, and almost doubled that. Even a few friends of mine who aren&#8217;t aware or believe in the open source movement use Firefox. This is the kind of application that will educate people to the beauty of open source.
