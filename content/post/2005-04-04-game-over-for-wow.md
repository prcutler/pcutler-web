[Slashdot linked to a story][1] on Grimwell.com [discussing WoW & MMO subscriber rates during launch and post-launch][2]. It takes a look at where WoW falls post-launch within the MMO genre, and speculates about WoW&#8217;s longevity.

It&#8217;s a good article, but could have been harder hitting. I agree with the premise: WoW&#8217;s future is in question. When you consider WoW&#8217;s issues with new content, fast levelling to 60, catered to &#8220;casual&#8221; play, and lack of social interaction, how long will players stick with it?

Here&#8217;s a snippet:

> Based on past trends of similar styled games, World of Warcraft will not retain players the same way that Everquest and Final Fantasy XI have. I expect it will fall to somewhere between a half to a quarter of its current subscribers. This is ratio greater than that lost in Planetside and City of Heroes because I believe the &#8220;core following&#8221; is far less than the runaway success World of Warcraft has been would indicate.
