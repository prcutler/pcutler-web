The new beta of the blog software works better as they&#8217;ve de-emphasized the multi-blog feature and made it easier to tweak.

Upgrade I did last night looks pretty good, I&#8217;ll keep it for now.

I did d/l IcculusNews and IcculusFinger. Icculus wasn&#8217;t kidding when he said it was lacking in documentation.   <img src='https://i0.wp.com/www.silwenae.net/blogs/img/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif?w=700' alt='&#58;&#68;' class='middle' data-recalc-dims="1" />It&#8217;s all Perl, couple daemons that run. I&#8217;m going to look into it as I&#8217;m still intrigued by it, but we&#8217;ll see in the long run.
