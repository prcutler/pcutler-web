One of my favorite miniseries from when I was a kid, [V: The Original Miniseries][1] has been in the news. Kenneth Johnson, the original writer / director [has struck a deal with NBC][2] to make a new 3 hour movie bringing V back.

Taking place 20 years in the future, mankind is still fighting the Visitors when a new ally shows up to help the humans win.

Too bad it&#8217;s not a mini-series. I bought V and V:Final Battle when they came out on DVD last year. Of course it wasn&#8217;t as good as I remembered it, but considering the first one was in 1983, it&#8217;s suprising how well it did hold up. I more than enjoyed watching it on DVD, especially without commercials, and the quality was really good.

We&#8217;ll see how good the new one is. <img src='https://i2.wp.com/www.silwenae.net/blogs/img/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=700' alt='&#58;&#41;' class='middle' data-recalc-dims="1" />
