I&#8217;ve upgraded the blog to [WordPress 1.5][1] gamma. Used last night&#8217;s nightly build, and everything seems to work. There&#8217;s a few bugs in the admin section, but they&#8217;re just visual.

I&#8217;ll have to mess with the visual settings a little bit, the categories tree structure has been replaced by an alphabetical list which I don&#8217;t care for. Oddly enough, in the admin section it&#8217;s still in the tree form. Oh well.

Changed the theme. Was using Kubrick for WordPress 1.2 &#8211; and they made that the standard theme in 1.5! That just won&#8217;t do. So I downloaded ShadedGrey from [WP-Themes.info][2].

Will have to play around with it a bit more, but so far so good.
