It&#8217;s been just over a year since we rolled out the new Foresight website, which is written in HTML.

After some on and off debate, we&#8217;ve made the decision to switch to a CMS (which makes it much easier to get volunteers involved), and as of last night we&#8217;ve picked [Joomla][1] over Drupal.

We&#8217;ve [set up our appliance on rBuilder,][2] and we&#8217;re looking for help in building and maintaining the appliance, and even more important in designing a Joomla template for the look and feel of the new Foresightlinux.org. A big thanks goes out to pscott, Lance Haig and Tomas Forsman for getting us this far.

Join the [marketing list][3] and give us a hand today!
