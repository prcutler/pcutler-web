I&#8217;ve been researching this for years, and waiting for the right moment, and that moment is quickly coming in to focus. That moment will entail buying all of the parts for a Home Theater PC and installing [MythTV][1] said HTPC.

What is MythTV, you ask? It&#8217;s a software program for Linux distributions, that manages all the media &#8211; TV recording, DVD playback, DVD ripping, burn TV to DVD, music, weather and more.

[Here is one man&#8217;s way to build a $500 MythTV PC][2]. I&#8217;m thinking mine will be a bit beefier, with a better processor, home theater looking case, more memory and much more storage.

More to come in the coming months.
