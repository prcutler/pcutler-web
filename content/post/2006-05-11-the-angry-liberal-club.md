[Via BoingBoing][1], C.B. Shapiro has written an amazing piece of work, titled &#8220;_Hark, the Angry Liberal Sings_&#8220;. I&#8217;ll let his words explain, he does a much better job than I ever could, and I couldn&#8217;t agree with him more:

> Thereâs been some [ink spilled lately][2] denigrating so called âangry liberals,â that is, people who have allegedly lost their right to be taken seriously because they are âangry.â And they are âliberal.â
> 
> Well, I hereby declare myself a charter member in the ALC (Angry Liberal Club).
> 
> Sure, at first I felt guilty &#8212; what right do I have as a patriotic American to be angry? Or liberal? Oh, I tried to repress the âangry thing,â I tried &#8212; if I was asked, I claimed I was a âpeeved moderate.â Or a âmildly upset centrist.â But after much work through âBITâ (Blog Immersion Therapy), I stopped feeling the shame. Iâm coming out of the closet to announce I am an Angry Liberal Guy. And I am pissed.

> You might be saying âMan, what are you so angry about, Angry Liberal Guy?â?
> 
> Iâve compiled a short (and by no means complete) list just so I could see it all in one place:
> 
> Iâm angry about the shredding of the constitutionâ¦illegal wiretapsâ¦falsified intelligenceâ¦secret prisonsâ¦ use of torture as an accepted means of interrogationâ¦Terry Schiavoâ¦the war on scienceâ¦denial of Global Warmingâ¦the fascistic secrecy of our elected officialsâ¦ presidential signings that declare the President above the lawâ¦the breakdown of the wall between church and stateâ¦the outing of a clandestine CIA agent for purely partisan political gainâ¦the corrupting influence of K Streetâ¦ the total sell-out of the legislative process to corporate interestsâ¦ appointments of unqualified cronies at every level of governmentâ¦Harriet Miersâ¦Brownieâ¦Abu Ghraibâ¦ Scooter â¦the complete mismanagement of the war in Iraqâ¦the lies about the complete mismanagement of the war in Iraqâ¦the grotesque budget deficitsâ¦ the pathetic response to Katrinaâ¦ a civil rights division dedicated to undermining civil rightsâ¦an environmental protection agency that refuses to protect the environmentâ¦ (Take a breath, Angry Liberal Guy.)
> 
> And Iâm angry about a smug, simple-minded, incompetent, unqualified President, and a press that denies the obvious fact that we have a smug, simple-minded, incompetent unqualified President.
> 
> If these things donât make you angry, I have to ask &#8212; what the hell is the matter with you?
> 
> And what would it take to make you angry? &#8212; C.B. Shapiro
