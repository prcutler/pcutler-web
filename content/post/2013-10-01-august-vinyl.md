Summer is the slow time for new music releases and August saw a number of great new releases, with even more coming later this fall.

Here&#8217;s some of the new releases I picked up on vinyl in August:

  * Superchunk &#8211; _I Hate Music_:  The alt rockers have been around since 1989(!) and I Hate Music is their tenth album.  The album is short and sweet, clocking in at just over 37 minutes.  If you&#8217;re a fan of Superchunk there isn&#8217;t anything new here, and that&#8217;s a good thing.  (I also picked up the Divine Fits 12&#8243; at the same time featured in the picture below).
  * Volcano Choir &#8211; _Repave_: Justin Vernon of Bon Iver joins up with Wisconsin&#8217;s Collection of a Colony of Bees for their second album.  Mr. Vernon says he didn&#8217;t write any of the music &#8211; the one chord he wrote the band didn&#8217;t use.  But to me, this could easily be a 3rd Bon Iver album.  [Barb Abney of The Current wrote a fantastic review][1] a couple weeks back when it was The Current&#8217;s Album of the Week.  Highly recommended.
  * Neko Case &#8211; _The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, The More I Love You_:  Neko Case released her 6th solo album and it&#8217;s fantastic.  The alt-country darling follows up 2009&#8217;s Middle Cyclone with an album that works through her recent depression after recently losing her grandmother and both parents &#8211; and it works.  The pacing of the album is fantastic and she clearly opens her soul and bares it all.  The vinyl release is stunning &#8211; both the artwork and [Side D of the vinyl release][2], which doesn&#8217;t have any music, features a stunning etching that covers the album.  Middle Cyclone was the first new vinyl album I bought on Record Store Day 2010 in clear vinyl and holds a special place in my heart.
