I heard on the way home last night on [National Public Radio][1], that the 2nd Circuit Court has [struck][2] [down][3] key portions of Section 505 of the [Patriot Act][4].

Specifically, Section 505 allows the Justice Department to send a NSL, National Security Letter, to businesses, demanding information related to terrorism, without a court order. U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marreo found this disturbing without judicial oversight. The Justice Department was required to submit a list of all businesses that they had done this to &#8211; and did, which was 5 pages long, _with every line blacked out_.

Judge Victor Marreo also struck down the portion that requires individuals and business not to disclose that the DOJ or FBI has requested the letter &#8211; so even if you receive one, you coudn&#8217;t tell a lawyer.

The challenge was brought by the [ACLU][5], representing a &#8220;John Doe&#8221; ISP &#8211; who by law the ACLU can&#8217;t mention by name.
