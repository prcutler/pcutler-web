Almost a month ago [Icculus][1] announced in his .plan file [he was porting][2] a game called [Second Life][3] to Linux, and included 3 screenshots.

Second Life is a fascinating experiement in the MMO genre. In some ways made for developers, it lets you own land, create and trade various items, all with a built in content creation tool. From the [What Is page:][4]

> It is a palette for creative self-expression like nothing you have ever seen. Jump in, find a sandbox, and start building.

Icculus&#8217; timing was amazing, as [Cory Doctorow][5], Copyfighter, EFF employee, and sci-fi author, was having a [book release party in the game][6].

Already available for Mac OS X and Windows, I&#8217;m anxiously awaiting the Linux port to try this out.
