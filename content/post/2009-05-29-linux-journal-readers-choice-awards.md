The Linux Journal has recently published the [2009 Reader&#8217;s Choice Awards][1].

GNOME was voted, by readers, as the &#8220;Favorite Desktop Environment&#8221; garnering 53% of the votes, with KDE in second place at 30%.

From the article:

> During the past year, GNOME has reached majority rule status, with 53% of you electing it your favorite desktop environment. This trend is despite the breakneck development of KDE 4 during the past year. Although GNOME garnered only a few more votes than it did in 2008, KDE&#8217;s vote count slipped as you&#8217;ve warmed to Xfce, Fluxbox and Enlightenment. The long and influential coattails of Ubuntu can only make any presidential candidate green with envy. 

Flattering words indeed!

Contrast that to the [2004 Readers&#8217; Choice Awards][2]:

> Favorite Desktop Environment
> 
> 1. KDE
     
> 2. GNOME
     
> 3. Window Maker
> 
> For several years now, KDE and GNOME have finished first and second, respectively, **_with an ever-increasing distance between the two. This year, KDE received two votes for every one GNOME received_**. Window Maker holds on to the number three spot, beating XFce by a single vote. No one said “they all suck” this year, and the only write-in voter who expressed frustration said he might try to write his own environment. 

(Emphasis mine).

I think the GNOME community should be very proud of the progress made within GNOME, which is reflected in these vote totals.

(Thanks to Claus on the [marketing list][3] for pointing out the latest Readers&#8217; Choice awards).
