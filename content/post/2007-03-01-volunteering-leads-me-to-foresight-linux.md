I&#8217;ve been trying to spend some time giving back to projects I believe in. I spent a weekend reading through Ubuntu wiki pages on everything from setting up a LoCo, to helping the documentation team, becoming an Ubuntu member, and a lot more. After being a little overwhelmed by some of Ubuntu&#8217;s processes (and I do understand why they have them considering the sheer number of users and folks involved), I volunteered to help write some copy for the new [gnome.org][1] website that will debut with the upcoming 2.18 release, take a crack at creating a GNOME 2.18 LiveCD, and am helping to try and get the [TCLUG][2] back up and running some regular meetings.

I spent a good chunk of last weekend trying to create a LiveCD, using scripts, a few different programs, and lots of research. I quickly realized I was just a bit, to put it mildly, over my head. I&#8217;ve been using Linux off and on for 8 years, a full time user for 2 years, but I&#8217;m a user, not a developer. I can barely compile my own packages, and even then I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not always doing it the &#8220;right&#8221; way.

In my travels in trying to build a LiveCD, I met a gentleman by the name of [Ken Vandine][3] on the gnome-marketing mailing list and in the #marketing IRC channel for GNOME, who has also stepped up to create a LiveCD for GNOME 2.18. Ken works for [rPath][4], whose goal is &#8220;[making software applications radically easier to create, deploy, and manage][5]&#8220;. Coincidentally, at our last TCLUG installfest last summer, Dave from rPath demoed their technology for us, showing us a really innovative way to create your own software, including things as complex as your own Linux distribution using their toolset. But back to Ken &#8211; not only did Ken seem pretty cool and helpful, turns out Ken is one of, if not the lead developer for [Foresight Linux][6].

Foresight is a GNOME-based distribution, that includes a lot of cutting edge software in the Linux community, including [Banshee][7] as the default music manager (and we know how much I love Banshee), F-spot, Beagle, among others. I think it&#8217;s safe to safe to say Foresight is a smaller Linux distribution when compared to leaders like Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo or Ubuntu.

I did something last Sunday I have done in almost 3 years &#8211; installed a different distribution of Linux that wasn&#8217;t Ubuntu. It was weird, but strangely comforting at the same time. I&#8217;ll post some thoughts on my experiences with Foresight later tonight in my next post.
