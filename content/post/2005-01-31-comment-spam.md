The Comment Spam I&#8217;m getting is out of control. I mention the word &#8220;poker&#8221; in a post Friday, and I&#8217;ve had spam sites try to add over 500 comments in the last 48 hours. I&#8217;ve tweaked the site a bit, and even before that, I&#8217;ve been lucky enough that none of the comment spam has gotten through yet.

It&#8217;s quite annoying to have it all sit in the moderation queue though. Rumor is [WordPress][1] 1.3 will be out soonish. I&#8217;m hoping it has built-in spam comment control, otherwise it&#8217;s time to start looking at some plugins.

How annoying.
