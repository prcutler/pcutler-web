Rock the Garden, [89.3 The Current&#8217;][2]s annual outdoor show in partnership with the [Walker Arts Center][3], is just under two weeks form announcing which artists will be playing to a sold out crowd in Minneapolis. The Current will be announcing the lineup on April 19th.

The boys over at [Reviler take a look][4] at who they think may be playing at Rock The Garden. With such categories as &#8220;Best Guess&#8221;, &#8220;Awesome Long Shot&#8221; and &#8220;Most Terrifying Prospect&#8221;. It&#8217;s a good list that will make you crack a smile.

Over at the S[tar Tribune&#8217;s Vita.MN, they also take a look][5] and share who won&#8217;t be there based on their current touring schedule. In some ways, this is a better list than Reviler, as some of the bands Reviler definitely doesn&#8217;t want to see (with the exception of one which I&#8217;ll let you the reader figure out) are already booked or touring. 

Want to take your own guess? V[ita.MN has a page up where you can choose][6] the bands you think The Current will be adding to this years Rock the Garden. See you there!
