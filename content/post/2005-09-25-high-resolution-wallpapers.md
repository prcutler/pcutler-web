Via [WeblogTools Collection][1] at [WordPress Planet][2]:

Here is a [collection of high resolution wallpapers][3] for folks with very normal to very large monitors. With resolutions of up to 2560&#215;1600, including my default resolution of 1920&#215;1200 (which can be very hard to find wallpapers for without streteching) the collections include a lot of high-res photo&#8217;s, as well as a few abstract art pieces.

I downloaded a couple and am currently using [Feathers.][4] Pretty.
