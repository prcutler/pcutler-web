My center channel on my receiver has stopped working for no apparent reason. I&#8217;ve swapped out speakers, cable, checked the connections and the settings, and all I get is warbly static out of my center.

No idea why it picked now to stop working. It&#8217;s 6 years old, and with the basement on the horizon, I really don&#8217;t feel like buying a new one for the living room.

Dammit.
