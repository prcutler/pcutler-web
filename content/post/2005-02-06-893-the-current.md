I&#8217;m consistently impressed with 89.3, KMCP, The Current. The music keeps getting better and better. I had some money left in my MusicNow account, so I took [Mary Lucia&#8217;s][1] advice and picked up Ted Leo & The Pharmacist&#8217;s Shake the Sheets. I had looked for it at Best Buy, but they had had only 2 of their older albums. I also picked up Tegan & Sara, a Canadian folk duo (sisters, I think) that have opened up for Sarah McLachlan a few times.

Both discs were their newest releases from late in 2004, and both kick ass. Ted Leo reminds me of a fast driven Tim Mahoney, with a similar vocal style, but very different musically. Tegan & Sara are impressive in their own way, with poppy, fast alternative.

About 2 weeks ago The Current started giving away bumper stickers one or two nights a week. Unfortunately, the volunteers were always in downtown St Paul or Minneapolis, or Uptown, and I live in the boonies in the suburbs. I was pleasantly suprised to get a letter from The Current yesterday with a thank you for donating, and one bumper sticker and 2 window clings, and a promise that my welcome kit would come in a month, and my vinyl record in a few more. Time to get a car wash, peel off my Kerry sticker, and replace it with something better.
