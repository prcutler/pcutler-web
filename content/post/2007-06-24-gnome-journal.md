The latest [GNOME Journal][1] was published today. Articles include:

  * Fun with Gstreamer Audio Effects
  * Exercising Your Application With Accerciser
  * GNOME.conf.au 2007 Wrap-up

And most importantly, my first contribution GNOME Journal,
  
[Creating the GNOME 2.18 Live Media: An interview with Ken VanDine][2]. Hopefully, this will be the first of many articles I hope to write in the future.

I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve ever told this story, but I first met Ken last February when I was trying to figure out how to build a new GNOME LiveCD. Dave Neary pointed me at Ken at one point, who was already working on this as well. After talking to Ken, he was lightyears ahead of my struggles as he was using the rPath toolset, which enabled him to quickly publish a GNOME 2.18 LiveCD. I helped out with the easy stuff, editing the LGO pages for Live Media, and the PGO page which was later committed.

Ken was so welcoming to the help, I gave Foresight Linux a try as he is the founder and lead developer. I had just installed it when I started the interview, and by the time the interview was done a month later, I was helping out Foresight with docs and website updates and other little stuff.

Three or four months later here we are, and I&#8217;m still going strong helping out, and I enjoy the Foresight community as much today as the first time I asked a question in IRC. I hope you enjoy the article as much as I enjoyed working with Ken writing it.
