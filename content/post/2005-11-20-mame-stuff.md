Speaking of building a MAME cabinet before, came across this at Digg.com today: [Emucation.Com, download roms][1]. They claim to be legal, but I&#8217;m not sure how (yet), unless they&#8217;re truly abandonware.

Linked off of their emulator page, is [Advance Projects][2], which includes AdvancedMAME (an emulator), AdvanceMenu (a menu program for collating all your ROMs), and AdvanceCD, a LiveCD that only takes up 20 megs, so you can fill the rest of the CD with your ROMs, stick it in any PC, power it on and it&#8217;s a full blown MAME box.

Definitely adding that to my bookmarks for when I&#8217;m ready to build my cabinet.
