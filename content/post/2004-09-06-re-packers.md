So I was close.

Couch gone. Both Ford & Vines gone.

Kept both kickers, good. Jenkins made it.

This R-Kal Truluck guy they traded a 5th and 6th rounder, better be good.

I&#8217;m not suprised Kenny Holmes and Larry Smith got cut. Holmes scared me with his injuries after the fiasco of Joe Johnson.

Good to see the practice squad flesh out with Scott Wells, Scott McBrien, and Kelvin Kight.

No word on McKenzie yet, but should be a fun season.
