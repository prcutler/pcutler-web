The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel has an [amusing interview][1] with Berke Breathed, of Bloom County / Outland / Opus fame.

I love Bloom County, as I&#8217;ve commented before. Re-reading and collecting those 80s comic books reminds me not only of my childhood, but how topical Mr. Breathed&#8217;s cartooning is and was. So much of what he talked about then still applies to today.

He has a 25th anniverary book coming out of his favorite Sunday comics he wrote.
