A new edition of the GNOME Journal is out now. Articles include a newcomer&#8217;s look at using the GTK+ toolkit; an overview of the Tango Project interview two of it&#8217;s most high profile contributors; and a look a company based on open source software, Fluendo.

There is also a letter from the editor, Jim Hodapp, inviting all of us who use GNOME to contribute articles.

I think I&#8217;ll start planning a contribution myself. With this month&#8217;s release of GNOME 2.18, the timing couldn&#8217;t be better.
