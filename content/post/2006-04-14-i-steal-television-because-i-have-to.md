I came across this blog post about stealing TV a few days ago: [I Steal Television Because I Have To][1].

The author is spot on &#8211; it&#8217;s not about theft, it&#8217;s about control. And sometimes recording TV something happens you couldn&#8217;t control, and you have no way to get the show you wanted to watch. A week ago Tuesday, my Season Pass on my TiVo for The Unit didn&#8217;t work. No idea why &#8211; no idea what channel it was trying to record, but it recorded a blank screen for an hour.

So I went and got the torrent.

The TV industry needs to wake up &#8211; and some are. ABC&#8217;s announcment this week that they&#8217;ll be releasing TV shows the day after &#8211; with non-skippable commercials &#8211; is a step. It will be interesting to see what the future holds, especially with TV-like content developed and delivered over the internet and not over the air.
