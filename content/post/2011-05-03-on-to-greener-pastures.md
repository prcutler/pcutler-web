Yesterday was my last day at Novell. I enjoyed the 1+ year I spent working there &#8211; helping to ship SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop to millions of end users through OEM partnerships was a fulfilling experience in knowing it helped Linux on the desktop grow.

To those of you I worked with and didn&#8217;t get a chance to say goodbye to yesterday, it was a pleasure working with you.
