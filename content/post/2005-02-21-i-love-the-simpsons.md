Last night&#8217;s episode of the Simpsons was hilarious. After Bart single handedly ruins the tourism industry for Springfield, the city adopts gay marriage to fix the tourism problem. Homer quickly becomes a minister to profit from performing the marriage ceremonies.

At one point, the show flashes a URL on the screen, and sure enough, Fox & the Simpsons actually created a website: [Springfield is for Gay Lovers of Marriage.][1]

That, the subject matter of the show, combined with ripping on Fox for reality TV, had me rolling last night.

Even after all these years, the Simpsons keeps the laughs coming.
