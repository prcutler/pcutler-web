Purchased ESPN NHL2k5 and Fable yesterday. Tried to buy Fable Thurs. night, but they were already sold out.

Fable is pretty cool. Some of the combat controls take some getting used to, especially spells, but the story is cool so far.

NHL2k5 is suprisingly good. NFL2k5&#8217;s Crib feature blows NHL2k5 away, NHL2k5s is a dumbed down version. You still have challenges and can buy stuff, but from a room and item perspective, it&#8217;s not even close.

I am enjoying it, though I need to tweak the settings. I beat Vancouver 2-1, and the Stars 3-1, but most of the games end up being about 5-2. My shots on goal are averaging almost twice the opponents. Presentation, Sound, Graphics are all 10/10. The reflection of the ice at the start of periods after the zamboni is there is amazing &#8211; you can see the reflection of the scoreboards, and it&#8217;s a beautiful thing.

Helping Kelly build shelves today. My version of helping is watching the kids.

Off to Lambeau tomorrow.
