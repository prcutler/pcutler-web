After lots of stops and starts over the last few years, which really isn&#8217;t worth recapping, the GNOME web team is [moving forward with a new www.gnome.org.][1]

After lots of chatter on the gnome-web mailing lists the last couple months, Lucas [organized a meeting][2], a [set of tasks to be completed][3], and the timeline.

Personally, I&#8217;m helping with the [content team][4] &#8211; do we have the right pages for the new www.gnome.org? Is the sitemap correct with how those pages flow? From there we&#8217;ll work on adding the content, and then editing.

Want to help? This is a great area to jump in and help &#8211; you don&#8217;t have to know how to code, just help us write some paragraphs!

Join the [GNOME Marketing mailing list][5] and get involved!
