[LinuxDevCenter.com: Installing and Configuring Ubuntu on a Laptop][1]. Jeremy Jones of the Weather Channel purchases a Dell, and installs Ubuntu on it.

It&#8217;s a pretty good overview, and he runs into a couple quirky things that installing Linux on a laptop always seem to have, but no more than desktop installations now. Linux installs on laptops have come a long way in the last two years or so. While I had a similar experience with HP dv1000, it always comes down to the little things. The only big thing I&#8217;m still stuck on is suspend support.

Pretty good article if you&#8217;re looking to install Linux or Ubuntu on a laptop, especially a Dell.
