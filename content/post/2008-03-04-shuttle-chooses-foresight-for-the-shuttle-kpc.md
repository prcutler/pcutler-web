Shuttle released a [press release today][1]:

> Shuttle Teams with Foresight Linux on $199 KPC
  
> City of Industry, CA., MArch 4, 2008
> 
> Shuttle today announced that the newly launched $199 KPC will feature the Foresight Linux operating system. With an intuitive interface and user focused design, Foresight does away with the need for users to be familiar with Linux.
> 
> A host of the latest software is packaged with the operating system, giving users convenient and enjoyable access to music, photos, videos, documents, and the Internet. Even keeping up-to-date with the latest features and fixes is a simple process with the user friendly update button.
> 
> Foresight uses the revolutionary Conary® Package Manager developed by rPath and distributed as Open Source software under the terms of the Common Public License. With the Conary® Package Manager, the system updates only the specific files in packages which need to be updated so updating takes little time and bandwidth.
> 
> Shuttles KPC includes many software packages already installed, including the OpenOffice.org® office suite, the Firefox® web browser, the Pidgin instant messenger, the Banshee music player, the Totem movie player, the F-Spot photo organizer, and Compiz for 3D desktop effects.

We&#8217;re putting a lot of work making sure Foresight 2.0 is ready and polished as we are excited to introduce Foresight to new users who buy Shuttle&#8217;s KPC. A new addition to Shuttle&#8217;s family of SFF (small form factor PCs), the KPC features the ability to customize the look of the front of the computer, and features a 80 GB hard drive, Intel Graphics, 512 MB ram, and choice of Intel processors.
