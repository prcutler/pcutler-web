The link of the day is [Postsecret][1].

Extremely popular at [Technorati][2], I had never heard of it, and it&#8217;s pretty interesting. What is it, you ask? From the site itself:

> PostSecret is an ongoing community art project where people mail-in their secrets anonymously on one side of a homemade postcard.

And they put up the pictures of said postcards.
