For the 2nd year in a row, the Wisconsin Badgers have won the Big 10 Men&#8217;s Basketball title. The big difference is this year they won it outright (as opposed to the 4 way tie last year).

Unfortunately the game was only available on the New England Sports Network so I was unavailable to watch it. (And what&#8217;s up with that? Why not Fox Sports, my regional sports network?) Congrats to all the players and Bo Ryan who becomes only the 3rd coach in Big Ten history to win a title in his first 2 seasons.

Now let&#8217;s win the Big 10 Tourney and on to the NCAA tourney!
