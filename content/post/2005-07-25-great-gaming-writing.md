More goodness via [Alice][1]:

Alice came across a [picture of herself][2] in [Second Life][3] with her avatar hanging on the wall, by a player named [always_black][4].

She then links to a story he wrote and calls it _the best piece of gaming writing I ever did read_.

And I agree. [Go read it.][5]
