Looking through the referrer logs on [silwenae.com][1] last night, I was surprised to see all the hits I&#8217;ve received from [Google][2].

Sure enough, I tested out the links, and searched a bit on Google, and then double checked this morning on a different browser and machine to make sure I&#8217;m not crazy.

[Silwenae.com][1], home of our World of Warcraft guild, [Apatheia][1], is currently the [10th search result][3] on Google when you search for [&#8220;WoW Guild&#8221;][3]. Front page of Google, baby!

Searching for [&#8220;wow screenshots&#8221;][4] results in the number **two and three spots on Google**.

Impressive. Google page rankings in search results are based on the number of people who link to you &#8211; and considering the search results for &#8220;wow screenshots&#8221; only has Blizzard above my website, that&#8217;s damn impressive.

Who knew I&#8217;d ever run a popular website after all the hobbyist versions I&#8217;ve had over the years?
