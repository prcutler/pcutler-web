And now, the news:

  * Alpha 3 is out! Read the [release notes][1], and remember this is an alpha &#8211; things will break, and it&#8217;s not quite ready for everyday use yet, but it&#8217;s close. [Download here][2].
  * The Foresight mailing lists are down due to this weekend&#8217;s [rBuilder][3] maintenance. Something about the MX record being screwy. Hopefully will be back soon. Foresight users outside of the US should see speed improvements in Conary now that rBuilder is in a new data center.
  * No one replied to [my thread on the Marketing mailing list][4] about the website that I linked to last week, and what they like in a website and what they don&#8217;t. That makes me sad. That might be ok, because:
  * We have another website mockup! Thorsten, a relatively new Foresight user, [submitted to the marketing list][5] a [potential mockup][6] for the new foresightlinux.org. Combined with [Nixternal&#8217;s recent mockups][7], I think we can have some discussion and pick one and start coding. 
  * I created a new page on the wiki &#8211; [Foresight Love][8]. Modeled after [GNOME-Love][9], which are bugs tasked in GNOME&#8217;s Bugzilla as &#8220;GNOME Love&#8221;, which means they&#8217;re easy to fix and good for beginners. The goal of this wiki page is similar to that and to the [GNOME GHOP][10], where developers can add to an ever growing to-do list of things that are easy for a new contributor to jump in an do. The page is still a framework, I need to add lots more links within the wiki and tasks. If you are a Foresight developer, and know of some easy tasks someone new could try, add them! This was inspired by Ken updating a page on the wiki last week listing all the trivial bugs in [JIRA][11].
  * Foresight will be at [SCALE][12] next month, and now [Flourish in Chicago in April][13]. Nice work [Kevin][14].
  * I was introduced to [Gobby][15] over the weekend. Gobby is a real time collaborative text editor. While I don&#8217;t think it will work for the userguide since we&#8217;re already using Mercurial, I think it might work well for things like the release notes, new website copy, or even the newsletter once we start publishing that in a blog and not the wiki. (Writing the wiki markup in Gobby would be kind of a chore). More to come.
  * If you&#8217;re looking for me in IRC or on email this week, I&#8217;ll be back Friday. Off to a conference for work all week.
