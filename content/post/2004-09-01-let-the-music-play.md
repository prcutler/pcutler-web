And the music server is back!

At a slightly different address, but symlinks worked perfectly.

I&#8217;m still using [Netjuke][1] to power the site. I&#8217;m disappointed, the developers have been promising Netjuke 2, with a tentative date of July 15th which came and went without a peep. Love Netjuke 1, I&#8217;m just disappointed they haven&#8217;t communicated anything yet.
