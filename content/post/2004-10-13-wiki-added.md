After some configuration hassles, I&#8217;ve added the [Wiki!][1].

I even threw a [FAQ][2] up and added the link to the sidebar.

The configuration hassles were minimal, mostly involved re-reading the directions five times to enable mysql support with encrypted password. Then I had to change a setting in the php.ini file. The error code was a little misleading that it made me think it was a Wiki configuration problem, instead of PHP, but some googling around got me the answer.

The funny thing about it is the Wiki comes with a number of differently themes to choose from (I have MacOSX up now). The built-in WordPress theme for Wiki was the exact same WordPress theme I was using on the blog. Until yesterday that is when I changed. But it&#8217;s staying the way it is.
