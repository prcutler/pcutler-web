The shelving in my office closet came crashing down a couple of days ago. Lots of books, CDs, computer parts and boxes are currently strewn about my office. This picture doesn&#8217;t do the mess justice:

It&#8217;s been a long week between my hard drive crashing, the shelving ripped out of the wall, and my onging DirecTV nightmare, which I&#8217;ll expound upon once it&#8217;s over.
